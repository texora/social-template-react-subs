        "body": "On this episode of RAS, we chatted with **Yumi Arts**, the creator of [Kitty Paradise](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/800f8a914281765a7d-KITTY), a collection of adorable and fun animated cats. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XDxdZSc.gif)\n\n\nHer collection is a testament to the fact that even in a crowded niche (pixelated art), there is room for innovation. Although drawn using such a limited art medium, her Kitties are all so diverse from each other. More amazing is their differences in emotional stance despite the emotionally muted nature of pixel art. Some Kitties seem happy while others seem angry; some are playful while others are serious; etc. I mean, there's even a kitty with a lightsaber. It's a fantastic display of artistic vision and control.\n\nWe had a great time chatting with Yumi and we hope you enjoy reading.\n\n----\n\n### **RMRK: How did you start your art career?**\n**Yumi Arts:** \n>  I never was a professional artist, but have been drawing for fun since childhood. I learned how to work with digital art and then pixel art. Pixels became my main style because it’s simple, yet you can always create more and more complex art. Single pixel can change a lot of things, especially in lower resolutions and it’s always a challenge to make an image that has actual emotions, not just a blank stare. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/REevhkp.gif)\n\n\n### **How did you get into NFTs?**\n\n>  I’ve been in crypto since 2016-2017, so NFTs attracted me almost right away. There are a lot of insane projects here, but for obvious and unfortunate reasons, NFT is associated with cash grab by a huge number of artists and collectors, especially when celebrities and influencers get involved.\n>  \n> I wanted to create something more sincere, if you get my point, and imagined a set of funky kitties, each with their own character. I’m really happy that so many got the idea and liked them! A lot of people wrote to me that Kitties made them or even their children smile and it feels extremely good to see such reactions.\n>\n> But still, to continue creating you need to provide value to people who trust you and buy your art. I’m trying to do my best to constantly increase value of Kitties and less than in a month floor price increased by 6 times. Not only Kitty owners make their portfolio more expensive, but they also receive constant bonuses and rewards.\n\n\n### **What is your favorite project that you’ve worked on?**\n\n> In terms of art it’s probably Kitty Paradise. Before it, I drew only for myself, and upcoming collections are not ready yet. But I also make soy wax candles! Maybe they can be turned into NFT + physical items one day lol.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/38flijx.gif)\n\n\n\n### **NFTs have provided accessibility and exposure to various forms of digital creations. Do you have new artists that you follow and what do you find interesting about them?**\n> Aaaaaa, there are so many of them! **Majon**, **[Shiba Tales](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/FoPRQcjYUXWXeQe9mJhSgK3MzfLSpMzB6UURgcqk4en8Fqf)** and **Tiffdairyqueen** make such nice characters. I also love more traditional art by **[Rubentopia](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/GvqD3GHvmcVpUQssW9dZrKmH5gabUXvNeeh9aUcHkC66Q7v)** and **Drawingkeith**. Of course, **[Apes’n’art](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/HXAi8NoJHQUU1FQUJrHYGtAECN1upNKgPPnJMj7er1eFRK8?page=1&tab=created&creator=true)** too has already become a symbol of ChaosDAO, and many, many more! It’s by no means a full list, just the first artists that came up in my mind.\n\n### **What is your creative process like?**\n> My creative process is different for each collection, but I suppose it would make most sense to talk about Kitties. I daily consume new art, books, movies, cartoons and other stuff, so my morning goal is to recall the most interesting ideas that can be used for new concepts as reference. Then I start to draw random stuff that can be placed on a Kitty and finally test it out. If it looks good, then I start to work with colors. Finally, it's time to set up frames (on some of the Kitties it is pure pain to make the animation) and MINT THE KITTY!\n\n\n\n### **Where do you get inspiration from?**\n> I get most of my inspiration by watching really good art. Overall it probably doesn’t look like it at this point, but some of my favorite artists are Q Hayashida and Zdzisław Beksiński. And, OF COURSE, I get inspiration from indie games. I really like Binding of Isaac and its concept actually fits the NFT theme really well – you stack items on your character and they are shown on your sprite. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FhpeBJy.gif)\n\n### **What are your goals in the NFT space?**\n> I would love to combine all of my ideas in a single metaverse (I hate this word already) that can possibly grow into a fully functioning world with characters, locations, interactions and much more. Before RMRK 2.0, I wouldn’t even dream about it, but considering all the functions provided here, it might be real someday.  And of course, I simply want to create art and show it to people.\n\n### **How do you feel the future of NFTs will look like?**\n> Right now, almost any person can tell that it's only beginning. Most people heard about crypto and NFTs only from news and have no idea what’s going on here. I’m sure we will be at a whole new level in a few years with NFTs being used to verify art, create fully working metaverses and even whole games with not minecraft level graphics like now, but on a new level.\n\n### **What would you most like an NFT platform to have?**\n> I want to see more interactions between NFT wallets and 3rd parties. It would be insane to see websites showing extra content to specific Kusama NFT holders or even shipping physical items after verifying the token. Overall 99.99% of stuff that I want is already being developed by the amazing RMRK team.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xN3RTre.gif)\n\n\n### **Have you thought of any interesting ways to use RMRK2.0 in your future collections? To get context, you can check out this [post](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/dawn-of-the-art-legos-18289).**\n> Well, right now I just made and sold my first Kitty Box. After a person stacks enough emojis on this box, it will develop into a Kitty NFT. RMRK 2.0 would allow me to make this stuff actually on-chain, not just manually. I’m really waiting for it.\nNFTs that you can equip are also a huge innovation! Even though it’s too late for Kitties to use most of this function (traits are already minted in the same file as Kitty obviously), I will definitely find a good use for it.\n\n\n### **What exciting new stuff can we look forward to from you?**\n> Right now, I’m planning to release a new collection that will be a bit more serious and personal. It will feature a set of cards with characters from my imagination, each of them unique and made from scratch. I’m planning to combine all sorts of art there, not just pixels, but it will be something really experimental (expect chaos).  First release will be limited to see if people will actually like it. If it works well, then I’ll start fully developing and expanding this small world from my head.\n> \n>And, of course, REWARDS! Each Kitty Paradise holder will receive a special NFT gift, gain access to members-only giveaways and much more! You guys are really best and I’ll do my best to add extra value to your Kitty investments!\n\n\n---\nWhat a great conversation! The statement that most stood out to me was *\"I simply want to create art and show it to people\"*. Given that we're in the NFT space, it is so easy to lose sight of what's intrinsic (innate desire) for the extrinsic (sales). Not saying sales aren't important--THEY ARE. But, they aren't the most important factor. At the core of what we do as artists is **self expression**. As such, it doesn't really matter if we get paid or not, we need to express ourselves. But more than expressing ourselves, we also need for people to see our work and give us compliments. \nI'm thankful to Yumi for reminding me of this simple fact. It's also nice to see that she cares a great deal about her early supporters. We look forward to her next release.\n\nCatch up with her on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/FUEGFWoPPtX4XkRzEnZnMgwGKENscHXAiEZy6kcgaDz1BY6?page=1&tab=owned), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YumiArtsNFT), and [Subsocial](https://app.subsocial.network/accounts/3qwNz3bHNxdR84GVY5fBbnbz4vx2JNf45AdyxsUSiogfKQHM).\n\n\n---\n**Are you a talented digital artist?

Aspiramos a combatir el maximalismo en cadena y creemos que el ecosistema es más saludable cuando las blockchains pueden comunicarse entre sí. Es por eso que nos llamamos una plataforma multicadena (multi-chain) de capa 0 (Layer-0), y con eso viene el desafío técnico de conectar redes de blockchains aisladas. En esta publicación, explicaré qué significa la interoperabilidad, la diferencia entre las cadenas de Capa 0 y Capa 1, cómo usamos la mensajería de consenso cruzado, en ingles es cross-consensus messaging (XCM) para realizar la comunicación entre cadenas de datos arbitrarios y cuáles son las diferentes formas de conectarse a Polkadot.\n\n**Un poco de historia: Interoperabilidad de redes de Internet aisladas**\n\nDesde principios de los 70 hasta los 80, Internet comenzó como redes aisladas entre universidades, agencias gubernamentales y el ejército. La investigación impulsada por estos participantes, así como por una comunidad entusiasmada de desarrolladores de todo el mundo, condujo al desarrollo del Protocolo de Control de Transmisión (Transmission Control Protocol) y el Protocolo de Internet (TCP / IP) que permitió que estas redes aisladas se conectaran, se ubicaran e **interactuaran** entre sí.\n\nPodemos pensar en el estado actual del ecosistema blockchain como los primeros días de Internet; una colección de blockchains aisladas que aún tienen que conectarse bajo un protocolo que les permite comunicarse entre sí. Polkadot busca convertirse en ese protocolo que permitirá que las blockchains **interoperen.** Es por eso que lo llamamos una *blockchain / protocolo de Capa 0.*\n\n**Capa 0 y Capa 1 (Layer 0 & Layer 1)**\n\nDesde una perspectiva de desarrollo social, escalamos como comunidades a estados nacionales en parte debido a la especialización de habilidades. Los miembros de la sociedad pueden optar por desarrollar sus habilidades y especializarse en áreas como medicina, economía, política, manufactura entre otras cosas; también pueden aprovechar una economía de comercio donde esas habilidades especializadas tienen un mercado. Podemos pensar en esas especializaciones como las soluciones de **Capa 1**: en el espacio blockchain, estos son Bitcoins y Ethereums. Y también podemos pensar en la economía y el mercado como la **Capa 0**. Esto es lo que Polkadot pretende ser en el ecosistema blockchain.\n\n**XCM**\n\nLa Mensajería de Consenso Cruzado, en ingles es Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) es un formato / paradigma de mensajería que permite la interoperabilidad de las blockchains de Capa 1. Se implementa en el nivel de Capa 0 y tiene múltiples funcionalidades de paso de mensajes. Para la capa 1 a la capa 1, existe el Paso de Mensajes Entre Cadenas, en ingles es Cross-chain Message Passing (XCMP) que aún no se ha implementado, pero está casi listo según la publicación reciente del [blog](https://gavofyork.medium.com/3b77b1373392) de Gavin. De la capa 1 a la capa 0, también dicho de Parachains hacia la Relay Chain, existe el Paso de Mensajes Hacia Arriba, en ingles es Upwards Message Passing (UMP) y la capa 0 a la capa 1, también dicho de la Relay Chain hacia las  parachains , tenemos el Paso de Mensajes Hacia Abajo, en ingles es Downwards Message Passing (DMP). XCM no tiene opiniones sobre la estructura de las cadenas en el extremo de envío y recepción, y puede pasar información no estructurada a muchos tipos de cadenas. Por lo tanto, permitir que cualquier tipo de cadena lo utilice para la interoperabilidad. Cubriremos esto con más detalle cuando lleguemos a la letra X.\n\n**Cadenas interoperables: parathreads / parachains / bridges**\n\nAhora que entendemos el concepto de Capa 0 y Capa 1, podemos hablar sobre los tipos de conexiones que las cadenas de Capa 1 pueden tener en Polkadot.\n\n**Parachain:** Las Parachains son soluciones de Capa 1 que se beneficiarán del consenso compartido y la seguridad conjunta de Polkadot. Los slots de Parachain son liberados lentamente por la red donde los proyectos potenciales de Parachain pueden presentar ofertas como candidatos de Parachain. La mayoría de los proyectos optan por realizar un crowdloan (préstamo colectivo) como mecanismo de recaudación de fondos para aumentar su oferta, de ahí su probabilidad de ganar un slot. Una vez que se gana un slot, el proyecto parachain se incorpora a Polkadot y ahora es parte del ecosistema.\n\n**Parathread:** Todos las Parachains son Parathreads por defecto. Las parathreads son slots de parachain debajo del capó, pero permiten que varias cadenas residan en ellas, lo que permite que las cadenas participen en el consenso por bloque. Para algunos proyectos, puede que no tenga sentido económicamente residir en un slot de parachain a tiempo completo, para esos proyectos tenemos parathreads.\n\n**Bridge:** Los puentes (bridges) son para cadenas económicamente soberanas ya establecidas que tienen una red ya establecida. Todavía hay formas de que esas redes se conecten a Polkadot y se beneficien de la economía.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Chilling others is a manual process and is restricted unless there is a large number of nominators (>90% of the limit of 22,500).\n    There are multiple development efforts to reduce (and hopefully essentially eliminate) the minimum nomination requirement. See this [Github issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9511) for details. Kian also has a non-developer-focused update on these efforts along with a description of the problem [here](https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376).\n*   **Merkle Science**, in cooperation with the anti-scam community-led team, published [a proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/620) for council feedback: the project aims to provide a solution for monitoring the Polkadot protocol to proactively and reactively fight the illicit use of the Polkadot tokens. More info on the proposal, along with the roadmap and budget can be found on [the post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/620).\n*   After a successful integration to Kusama Network (you can review their proposal for Kusama [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/297) and [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/352)), **Klever** published their **[proposal to integrate Polkadot Network into their wallet](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/627)**. The wallet includes the following features: deposit/receive, withdraw/send, balance, History, bonding, staking and collection of staking rewards, swap, and restore/backup of address.\n*   A new slashing event happened in era 470 and it remains unapplied until now. The operator, **AllNodes**, requested a cancellation based on the fact the event will ban them from participating in the 1000 Validator Program.\n    In [their post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/623), they mentioned:\n    > \"what led to slashing was us trying to move our node to upgraded hardware without knowing that the node instantly loads any new keys without having to restart. The plan was to turn off the old node after adding new keys to the new node before restarting it.\"\n    Unfortunately, **[Motion 111](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/111)**, looking to cancel the slash, has been rejected by the Polkadot Council.\n*   A [Treasury Proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/112) is under consideration by the Council to fund updating the Guide to Polkadot-JS.\n*   **[Motion 110](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/110)**, for funding a Treasury Proposal for **Subscan**'s operating costs from June to August 2021, was approved by the Polkadot Council.\n    \n\n* * *\n\n_Want to sponsor a future issue of Dot Leap?

        "body": "As one of the projects joining Kusama parachain auction, Kintsugi can be considered as a bright candidate for achieving a parachain slot. Aiming to bring trustless Bitcoin to the Kusama network, Kintsugi is receiving a lot of attention from the community. PolkaWarriors community is very happy to host our 35th AMA with Kintsugi. The participation of Alexei Zamyatin has made the community very excited, during the AMA, he has responded to a lot of interesting questions as well as revealed about the project's upcoming plan and strategies.\n\n# Below is a summary of the outstanding questions and answers from the AMA session.\n**1. Can you introduce the operating mechanism and technical implementation of Kintsugi products?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nkBTC is a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on Kusama, following a similar design as MakerDAO’s DAI.\n\nThe process of minting and redeeming BTC for kBTC is as follows:\n\n1. **Issue:** Lock your BTC with a Vault. Pick one, or run your own. Your BTC is always safe and insured by Vault collateral.\n2. **Mint:** Get kBTC at a 1:1 ratio to your locked BTC.\n3. **BTC DeFi:** Earn on your Bitcoin. Use kBTC as collateral, for lending, yield farming and more across the DeFi ecosystem.\n4. **Redeem:** Redeem kBTC for actual BTC on Bitcoin - trustless and anytime you want.\n\n![](https://dotmarketcap.com/uploads/tinymce/photo_2021-09-25%2019.45.12.jpg)\n\nWhat makes kBTC unique is the strict dedication to being trustless and decentralized.\n\n**Secured by Insurance**\n\nVaults lock collateral on the kBTC parachain in various digital assets- in a MakerDAO-inspired multi-collateral system. If Vaults misbehave, their collateral is slashed and users reimbursed. As a user, you only trust that Bitcoin and the DeFi platform you use are secure.\n\n**Radically Open**\n\nAnyone can become a Vault and help secure kBTC, anytime. Yes, you can run your own Vault!\n\n**2. How are the Tokenmetrics of Kintsugi designed? What are the utilities of its token?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nKintsugi will be governed by its community from day 1 - via KINT, Kintsugi’s governance token. KINT tokens will be distributed to network participants, builders and early backers as airdrops and block-rewards. No public sale or ICO is planned.\n\nThe KINT token’s main purposes are:\n\n**Governance.** KINT holders vote on governance proposals and elect council members to make operational decisions. To vote, KINT is locked and users earn staking rewards.\n\n**Utility.** Kintsugi will support transaction fee payments in KINT and other digital assets, in addition to KSM.\n\n**Outlook.** Long-term, Kintsugi governance may also decide to activate fee sharing among KINT holders, distributing the revenue earned by the network from bridging BTC, other assets, as well as BTC DeFi Dapps built on top of the EVM (yet, Kintsugi is adding EVM support with BTC specific functions!)\n\n**Supply and Emission**\n\nKINT features an unlimited supply. The emission schedule is defined as follows:\n\n* 10 million KINT emitted over the first 4 years (4:3:2:1 million)\n* 2% annual inflation afterwards, indefinitely.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nKINT will be controlled by the community:\n\n* 70% is distributed to the community\n* 30% is airdropped to the Interlay team (current & future), and early & future investors, who funded development of the protocol - subject to 48 weeks lockup, followed by 48 weeks linear vesting.\n\n**Important:** starting in year 5, only the community receives new KINT from the annual inflation.\n\n![](https://dotmarketcap.com/uploads/tinymce/photo_2021-09-25%2019.45.49.jpg)\n\nRead more in the token economy whitepaper released by Kintsugi Labs (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interlay/whitepapers/master/Kintsugi_Token_Economy.pdf)\n\n**3. BTC is locked at which address? We know BTC doesn’t have a smart contract, so it will hold a secret key-controlled address, right? Who will have that secret key? RenBTC has a set of people signer, but it is not perfect. So how will Kintsugi do better?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nBTC is locked with a Vault.\n\nAnyone can become a Vault by locking collateral (e.g. in KSM, DOT, USDC, …) on the parachain and registering with their BTC public key. \n\nThe Vault in theory has full control over the BTC - but if it tries to steal it’s collateral will be slashed on the parachain and users will be reimbursed at a 110% rate.\n\nRenBTC holds BTC in a centralized multi-sig, which seems to be controlled by the team, according to reports published online. Here the problem is (1) you cannot join the multisig and (2) if BTC is gone there is no insurance to reimburse users.\n\nA good comparison to other approaches can be found here:\n\n![](https://dotmarketcap.com/uploads/tinymce/photo_2021-09-25%2019.47.06.jpg)\n\n**4. Revenue is a key factor for all projects to survive and keep the projects running. What is Kintsugi' way of generating profit and revenue? What is Kintsugi' revenue model?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nKintsugi is community owned - so Interlay does not charge any fees for operation. Vaults earn fees from issue & redeem and earn KINT tokens as block rewards. We are also adding an EVM which will allow BTC DeFi products, such as trading the original NFTs such as Pepecash, or building Bitcoin derivatives. In the mid-term, the system will activate fee sharing: a part of the trading fees will be routed back to the network.\n\n**5. People are always worried about the transaction speed because they worry about their transaction going to fail. How fast and secure is \"Kintsugi' platform? If the number of users spikes, will transactions on \"Kintsugi' get congested?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nKintsugi benefits from Kusama’s / Polkadot’s performance: we anticipate over 1000 tx/second. This means: the issue and redeem process will be slow because Bitcoin block times are slow - but once you’re in the KSM/DOT ecosystem you benefit from high performance. \n\nJust like any system, KSM/DOT have a limit - but it is much much higher than that of Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\n**6. DEFI is evolving too fast and the ability to break is very high. What do you think about this and can you be sure that Kintsugi's products will be demand in the long term? What is Kintsugi planning to contribute to DeFi's growth?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nBitcoin is the largest asset in terms of market capitalization (846 billion USD). It is also the asset that is most known outside of the crypto space and is being used as alternative investment by many. \n\nAs time progresses, we will see more and more regulations targeting USD stablecoins - with KYC requirements etc. \n\nMore and more users will switch to crypto-only starting with Bitcoin (e.g. we already have governments accepting BTC). \n\nKintsugi & Interlay are pioneering how BTC (and other assets) can be used in DeFi - as such we believe that we will contribute to on-boarding many new users into DeFi.\n\n**7. What are the key features of Interlay that sets it apart from other projects and what competitive advantage do you have? How has the experience and background of the Interlay team been effective in the project's success so far?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nKey features: full decentralization and game theory to make sure that users are insured against theft. Interlay is the only project that has managed to build a fully decentralized way to bring BTC to DeFi - basically, the MakerDAO of Bitcoin DeFi (if looking at the tech).\n\n![](https://dotmarketcap.com/uploads/tinymce/photo_2021-09-25%2019.48.37.jpg)\n\nAlso, this shows why we need decentralized BTC\n\nInterlay was founded by ex-Imperial College PhDs who have been doing R&D on Bitcoin since 2015. We are experts in cross-chain communication and DeFi mechanisms (e.g. stablecoins) and work with leading projects and research labs to constantly improve the status quo.\n\n**Fun fact:** my PhD was on cross-chain communication. Dom's PhD on game theory, stablecoins and DeFi. \n\nInterlay combines these two in practice :)\n\n**8. A strong community not only brings interesting ideas to the project but also attracts larger partners. So how is Kintsugi planning to build its community? And is there a plan to recruit people with Blockchain experience to the Kintsugi team?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nIn September we launched our Ambassador program that aims to integrate and involve its  growing, vibrant community of coders, researchers and early Bitcoiners, Polkadot & Kusama followers & spokespeople, DeFi natives and anyone who is passionate about changing the centralized status quo.\n\nAnyone can apply for the program. It is not a recruitment and is totally on a volunteer basis. Once accepted, a member starts as an Apprentice and based on his/her performance and value added to the community, is promoted to an Ambassador and eventually to Senior Ambassador. \n\nCurrently we have 3 Ambassadors and 40 Apprentices and every week we are adding more members to the program. \n\nInterlay is also actively hiring across all fronts: engineering, marketing, and business development.\n\n# In the live questions section, Alexei did answer several short questions from the PolkaWarriors community. \n**1. Since NFT is popular nowadays, is there a plan for NFT integration?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nYes! We are adding EVM support and in this way want to bring some of the very first NFTs to Kusama - for example Pepecash. You can then build DApps for these NFTs, or trade these potentially on RMRK.\n\n**2. Non-crypto users are very important for mainstream adoption. How are you planning to attract non-crypto users towards your project? Is there any upcoming partnership that will bring non-crypto users and real-use cases?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nBTC is the asset that is known best outside of core crypto. By making BTC available on DeFi, we hope to onboard many new non-expert users. And, then there is interBTC 2.0...\n\nImagine if you could lock BTC in your wallet e.g. for a year.... and start earning yield!\n\n--> coming in 2022, a new way for BTC DeFi - for pro's & newbies alike.\n\n**3. As the cost or fees of BTC change to WBTC is about 0.25% or so, how about the cost of iBTC change to interBTC in Ethereum? Are there any other fees for BTC change to interBTC?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nwBTC currently can charge high fees because they have a monopoly. We will change that :)\n\ninterBTC will have \n\n* a small fee for minting/redeeming \n* the Kusama transaction fees (but these are much smaller than on Ethereum)\n* the fees for the BTC transaction as part of the deposit\n\nLong term, we expect to have a free market among Vaults, as they compete for BTC of users.\n\n**4. Do you have tutorial videos so we can get to know your project more clearly or do you have a YouTube channel or something? can you share it with us?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nAll the info can be found at docs.interlay.io -- we will keep this up to date with all new features!\n\nYou can also follow us on Twitter for latest updates: \n\n* https://twitter.com/interlayHQ,\n* https://twitter.com/inter_btc\n* https://twitter.com/kintsugi_btc\n\n**5. Can you tell us more about potential partnerships with other Polkadot projects and how interBTC / kBTC will be integrated with other parachains?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nkBTC can be integrated into any parachain via XCM. Obvious targets are Karura, Moonriver, Basilisk, Shiden, ...\n\nWe already integrated with Bifrost's SALP. \n\nWe started out \"Featured Use Case\" blog post series: https://medium.com/interlay/featured-use-case-chaotic-btc-defi-with-kintsugi-karura-8b1a62b430d9\n\nKeep an eye out for the next updates!\n\n**6. In the next 3 years, what is your orientation for the Interlay & Kintsugi project? What difficulties are you going to face in the near future?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nOver the next 3 years...\n\n* We will launch on Kusama\n* launch on Polkadot\n* expand to Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana etc. \n* add EVM support for BTC defi contracts\n* add some OG Bitcoin NFTs\n* Launch interBTC 2.0\n* Integrate with top 20 DeFi projects to allow 1-click BTC DeFi\n\n**Challenges:** it's a David vs Goliath battle with wBTC. We will need a lot of support from our community - but we are sure we can win because we have the better product and community\n\n**7. What did you learn from the early versions of Interlay product or services? What are some of the major roadblocks on Interlay?**\n\n**Alexei:**\n\nWe started working on this in 2018. We learned the hard way that a paper =/= product when we actually built interBTC - we fixed many bugs and solved many problems to get here. One of the main challenges was capital efficiency and a sensible token model - but we managed to solve that too by doing a lot of research. \n\nOne major learning was that community is the most important thing for interBTC. We received so much good feedback that allowed us to make the product better - this is why we made sure that the community is in charge of making decisions.\n\n# About Kintsugi BTC\n[Website](https://kintsugi.interlay.io/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kintsugi_btc) | [Telegram](https://t.me/interlay_community) | [DMC](https://dotmarketcap.com/coin/kintsugi/1)",

Similar to the relationship between Polkadot and its “canary network” Kusama, Heiko Finance is the sister network to Parallel, and the parachain that Parallel hope to launch on the Kusama blockchain.\n\nAs one of strong competitors of the 2nd batch of Kusama slot auctions, Heiko joined the auction. In order to promote the partnership of us, Bifrost wishes to boost the winning rate of Heiko’s parachain auction. All Heiko’s contributors who contribute though SALP protocol will be able to join the derivative mining with vsKSM, and receive Bifrost native token (BNC) as reward.\n\nOnce Heiko wins the auction, the vsKSM will be tradable for swap between KSM and other assets effortlessly, and contributors be able to get HKO as Crowdloan reward, stay tuned.\n\n# Heiko Crowdloan Rewards\n\n* Contributors will be rewarded with Heiko tokens (HKO) and as high as 5% of the HKO total supply will be distributed (4% for Contributor rewards, 1% for recommender rewards.)\n\n* Every KSM contributed should return at least 200 HKO tokens.\n\n* Heiko rewards up to 50 million HKO tokens\n\n* Voters will receive a weighted distribution of up to 5% HKO\n\n* 200,000 KSM is the largest amount raised by Heiko in the second round of parachain auction\n\n***\n# What is Heiko\n\nHeiko Finance is the sister network to Parallel Finance, which is offering Lending、Staking、Borrowing products to Kusama Network. Parallel Finance(Heiko Finance) just closed a Series A round which led by Polychain Capital, along with Pantera Capital、Lightspeed Ventures、Alameda Research and etc. Parallel has also received a Web3 Grant and been a member of DeFi Alliance and Substrate Builders program. Learn more about Parallel and Heiko: https://parallel.fi/\n\n***\n# What is SALP?\n\nSALP (Slot Auction Liquidity Protocol) aims to issue derivatives vsKSM for KSM contributors, vsKSM can be used for DeFi applications such as swap and liquidity mining during the KSM bonding period, exchange KSM in AMM at any time.

Our main task — increase the value of the Substrate ecosystem by involving many people focused on growing the product, community and power. Main goal — to give the Polkadot and Substrate community the real utility to promote Substrate projects. We think that all adopters of Polkadot are the huge power to make substrate projects known worldwide. It’s a big deal to involve a lot of Polkadot adopters in promotion on the ground, in their regions. We build the model for such an activity for the whole community to make important contributions. The results will be successful businesses, DAOs, DAPPs and other units.\nOur team wants to become an infrastructure for substrate and parachains projects to promote their services, ideas and the whole Polkadot ecosystem worldwide. We want to integrate other crypto activists in Polkadot ecosystem promotion.\n",

This means that every participant can maintain exactly one digital identity and that every participant gets a fixed amount of cryptocurrency per month. In contrast to other known cryptocurrencies, encointer issues local currencies, meaning that their issuance is locally bound. The currency of Benin can have a different exchange rate than that of Norway.\r\n\r\nEncointer currencies feature nominal demurrage: All balances get devalued over time. 10 units you own today turn into 5 units within one year. Think of this devaluation like a payment to a solidarity fund that pays for the UBI. This way, Encointer can issue monthly UBI and still maintain stable money supply. Demurrage increases money velocity, which in turn fuels the local economy.\r\n\r\nPrivacy is a major focus of Encointer. The protocol leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enhance the privacy of its users and also increase scalability by delegating transactions off-chain into TEEs. We use SubstraTEE for this, another Polkaproject developed by our team.",

If you missed it or couldn't attend, please read on.\n\n# Spacers 1.0\nThe initial launch of The Spacers Program was rushed, and it was not designed well. We did not have good incentives in place, let alone a solid direction. In the end, it was a non-starter.\n\nUpon recognizing this, we set out to fix all of these issues. The changes and improvements are outlined below.\n\n# Spacers 2.0\nWith the 2.0 update, The Spacers Program now borders on being a play-to-earn game. There are Missions to complete, Ranks to be gained, Rewards to be earned, and more. Hang around long enough and you might even end up with a solid item for your resume. Do note that this post will not contain in-depth details. If you would like all of the information, please refer to the official [Spacers Program document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBtTXa8uC5AU01mp5VdaQjHoI9r6nlADn8d6YTRfu0o).\n\nBut enough talk, let's dive in.\n\n**Seasons**\n\nAt the heart of the program are seasons. Each season will run for four weeks, and feature a leaderboard for that season. The purpose of seasons will become clear as you read on, but they needed to be introduced ahead of time.\n\nThe first official season will start on October 4th at 3PM UTC. Between now, September 18th, and then, we will be running a pre-season. What sets the pre-season apart is that any of the information presented below may be changed before the first official season begins on October 4th. It is a testing ground, of sorts. That said, all experience and rewards earned during the pre-season will be valid.\n\n**Missions**\n\nThe primary duty of Spacers is to embark on Missions that will expand our empire to the far reaches of the SubVerse. By successfully completing missions, Spacers will earn experience and rewards.\n\n**Ranks**\n\nAll new recruits start out as Space Plebs. When new Space Plebs show up, we will send them out on their very first Mission and hope they don't get killed by space bugs.\n\nThere are two types of ranks: Crew members and Officers. The Crew ranks range from Space Pleb all the way to Master Chief. The Officer ranks consist of Captains, Commodores, and Admirals. Officers ensure the smooth operation of The Spacer Fleet, and Spacers must do more than simply complete Missions to become an Officer.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nAs compensation for risking their lives fighting aliens and battling space bugs, Spacers deserve rewards.\n\nAll Spacers will receive a rank-specific role in our Discord server. In addition, we plan to award special NFTs to all Spacers depending on their rank.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the meat and potatoes of the rewards: tokens. Subsocial tokens will be distributed to Spacers that successfully complete Missions. Token rewards will be distributed following every season.\n\nReward multipliers are also featured, and will be reset at the beginning of each season.\n\n**Documents & Forms**\n\nFor the full details on The Spacers Program, see the [official document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBtTXa8uC5AU01mp5VdaQjHoI9r6nlADn8d6YTRfu0o/). \n\nTo apply, please fill out the [application form](https://forms.gle/4pUxAtrNxDZymvqr9). \n\nHere are the [program guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_AgSOicp_8pWbsd1Cq4I73--Ok6Oi6COKgkcwR0P6MQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nTo submit a Mission Report, please fill out the [Mission Report form](https://forms.gle/rwbGUgM26htAefAc7). \n\nIf you have any ideas on how to improve the program, please send us a [suggestion](https://forms.gle/DN2wbu65FXN8sj1E6).",

We have yet another update in the works for [Sub.ID](https://sub.id/#/): We will be adding a slot for a rectangular banner at the top of all profiles!\n\nHowever, these won't be any old banners, they will **only** be NFTs. We are building it in such a way that the only banners you can use are NFTs that you own, so you either have to create your own banner, or buy one from a banner artist.\n\nNow, why are we looking for artists? We are seeking to partner with banner creators for a wide selection of possible banners that people can purchase for their Sub.ID profile. Artists will create and mint their work, and sell it directly to their customers, as always. Where we come in is that we will be recommending certain collections of \"SubBanners\" to Sub.ID users who are interested in purchasing a banner (think of Curated pieces on Singular). It is essentially free marketing for you, and we are creating an entire new market segment. Everyone already uses NFTs for profile pictures, but hardly anyone uses or makes NFTs for banners. Perhaps this will kickstart the Twitter NFT banner craze…\n\n# The Details\n- Sub.ID Banners will have an aspect ratio of 3:1, and preferably be at least 1500x500 pixels.\n- Please create a new collection for banners, and include \"SubBanners\" in the name.\n- SubBanners can be minted on [Singular/RMRK](https://singular.rmrk.app/) or [Unique Network](https://unqnft.io/#/market).\n- A space theme is preferred (planets, aliens, spaceships, etc.) but not required, you can create anything you wish. Unique generative patterns are also highly desired.\n- SubBanners can be images or short video clips/gifs.\n- Feel free to also make profile picture/avatar NFTs (at a 1:1 aspect ratio, 500x500 or higher) along with SubBanners and sell them as a pair. If doing so, please create a collection with \"SubCombos\" in the name.\n- Use .svg file format if you want to future proof them for RMRK 2.0\n\nIf you are interested, please get in contact with us through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SubsocialChain), [Discord](http://discord.gg/w2Rqy2M), or [Telegram](http://t.me/Subsocial).",

All ongoing crowdloans, and those that previously won, will be shown. The amount of KSM that you locked in a crowdloan is shown along with the USD value. If you check the box labeled \"Show all crowdloans\" you will be able to see all crowdloans, even those you did not contribute to. This feature provides an easier way to see this than navigating through Polkadot.js, and let's you copy the contributions of people you may consider to be better at allocating their capital than you, assuming you have one of their addresses.\n\n\n# NFTs\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/841353990103892038/885518457960034304/NFTs.png)\n\nDown at the very bottom of the page you will be able to see all of your NFTs across Unique Network and RMRK (and they load notably faster too). You can scroll through the pages to view them all. Clicking on the picture will take you to Unique or Singular to view the NFT's page. Of course, you can also look up someone else's Substrate account on Sub.ID and see all of their NFTs easily too. We are making sure to do our part to fuel the bright future of NFTs!\n\nYou can check out some examples here: \n* https://sub.id/#/ssbzsm4LpAm9ebJ3wvbYv3PK7ZBuyuioxc3jF7znoJqvVvp\n* https://sub.id/#/5G1oSMnEAE9LLy9vxTMKognyatrnRL5hgsGVFumurRL4DXWV\n\nIf you have any ideas on how Sub.ID can be improved, you can suggest them through the Suggest Ideas button on the top left corner of the [dApp](https://sub.id/#/).",

We have been hard at work over here, and lots of exciting stuff has happened.\n\n\n**Team Growth** \n\nOur team has grown quite a bit this month! We have grown from a team of four to a team of seven. Joining us we have Zachary a.k.a. [Yung Beef](https://app.subsocial.network/4779), working on marketing and community, Tarek, building our new mobile app, and Vitalii, our UX designer. It is a pleasure to have these guys on the team and we are looking forward to working with them!\n\n\n**Sub.ID**\n\nOn August 13th, we unveiled [Sub.ID](https://sub.id/#/), the one stop shop for all of your Substrate accounts and balances. Since then, [Vlad S.](https://app.subsocial.network/1628) has expanded upon it, adding four more chains and detailed balance information for Karura. Work on Sub.ID will continue as we integrate more Substrate based blockchains, plus additional in-development features.\n\nIf you would like to read more about Sub.ID, please check the announcement we put out about it. We hope that you continue to find value by using Sub.ID!\n\n\n**Treasury Proposal Posts**\n\n[Vlad S.](https://app.subsocial.network/1628) has also been working on building functionality that integrates Kusama treasury proposals with posts on Polkaverse. We see this as an upgrade over Polkassembly, which is siloed from our social networks, and is mainly used just for treasury/governance communications. Migrating these discussions onto Polkaverse enables them to be integrated into the everyday discussions surrounding the ecosystem as a whole, and will make them more readily available and easy to find.\n\n\n**Tips**\n\n[Oleh](https://app.subsocial.network/@olehmell) has been building out our Substrate pallet designed for tipping functionality, and implementing it in our user interface. This will make it super easy to tip others on Subsocial if you like their content. Tips will go directly from your wallet to theirs, with no one taking a cut.\n\nWhile this will be the first monetization method implemented, it is far from the last, as we have multiple other avenues planned for development.\n\n\n**Mobile App**\n\nTarek has been working on our up and coming mobile app, **Dotsama News**.\n\nWhile building our mobile app for Subsocial, we initially built a read-only version that allows you to see posts and comments on Subsocial, but not interact with the platform. Though this was originally just a milestone on the way to a fully functional Subsocial app, we decided to add a little more work and create a functional product out of it. Dotsama News will launch cross-platform, assuming we have no issues with app stores.\n\nDotsama News curates the content on Subsocial in such a way that it only shows news relevant to the Dotsama ecosystem. We know how much content there is on Twitter to wade through in order to find the important nuggets, which is why Dotsama News will be so helpful. If you are interested, you can help us by asking your favorite projects to begin posting on Subsocial, if they do not already. We reserved spaces for every project in the ecosystem, which can be claimed [here](https://app.subsocial.network/spaces/claim).\n\nIn future versions of the app, we will enable full functionality, so that you can truly use Subsocial from your phone. Additionally, the app will handle signing transactions, so you will not have to sign a transaction any time you perform an action. Can you say smooooth?\n\n\n**Validators**\n\n[Vlad P.](https://app.subsocial.network/@f3joule) has been working on getting us ready to begin onboarding validators to decentralize the network ahead of our mainnet launch (we are currently running a pre-mainnet in parallel to our betanet)! We will soon begin accepting applications for validators, so if that interests you, keep an ear open for an announcement.\n\n\n**The Spacers Program**\n\nA few weeks ago we initially launched The Spacers Program, our version of an ambassador program. Zachary has onboarded some excellent Spacers so far, and is in the process of collaborating with them to revamp the entire program. Stay tuned for that, it will be legendary.\n\n\n**Subsocial Fiesta**\n\nIn the spirit of decentralization, we have launched the #SubsocialFiesta, a decentralized marketing campaign. The purpose of the Fiesta is to spread the word about Subsocial far beyond the reaches of our community, via articles, videos, and memes. Participation is, of course, rewarded. To learn more, check out the announcement [here](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial/the-subsocial-fiesta-19247).\n\n\n**Relay Chain Podcast**\n\nParity's Relay Chain podcast recently invited our founder, [Alex](https://app.subsocial.network/@AlexSiman), onto the show, along with Zachary, to discuss all things Subsocial. They covered some very interesting topics, and the podcast will be available soon.\n\n\n**Just Another Day In The Home Office**\n\nIt's been hectic around here with so much going on, but we love what we do. All of this work is dedicated to building a true Web 3.0 ecosystem for the next generation of social networks, so that we can create content, earn the full value of it, and socialize online with true freedom.\n\nWe have loads of exciting stuff in the pipeline - to keep up to date, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SubsocialChain) and [Subsocial](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial), and join our [Discord](http://discord.gg/w2Rqy2M) and [Telegram](http://t.me/Subsocial) groups.\n\nThank you for your support,\n\nThe Subsocial Team",

Yes, while people do make money, it is nowhere near as much as they should. YouTube takes a 45% cut of the ad revenue!\n\nThis is completely outrageous, but the problem is that there is nowhere else for people to go. Platforms that don't take a cut hardly receive any traffic, and as a result, the content creators hardly make any money. It is a sad state of affairs when the highest revenue option involves only receiving 55% of the value that you create.\n\nFortunately for us, we are currently living in the greatest period in human history. A new era has arrived, and brings with it a champion: **Web 3.0**.\n\nWeb 3.0 brings an entire new paradigm to the table, enabling people to create content **and** earn the full value of it - nobody else takes a cut. It achieves this by utilizing [Social Finance](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial/the-future-of-social-networks-and-financial-integration-19300).\n\nSocial Finance, or SoFi, is a combination of social networks, which originated with Web 2.0, and Decentralized Finance, built with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.\n\nThe key with SoFi is that it keeps the good parts of traditional social networks while removing the bad parts, such as getting up to 45% of your revenue taken by a third party.\n\nThe result is a Web 3.0 social network, such as Subsocial, created with Social Finance in mind. Because Subsocial is built on top of decentralized architecture, and integrates cryptocurrencies, there is no central platform that can take a cut of your revenue. All content monetization revenue goes directly to the creators!\n\nSo how will we take advantage of this new model? What new possibilities will people achieve, utilizing all of the brand new opportunities enabled by Web 3.0 and Social Finance?\n\nA mass exodus from Web 2.0 monetization platforms such as YouTube is bound to happen, with content creators flocking to new platforms that allow them to capture the full value of their work. Creation will thrive like never before!\n\nWill you lead the charge?",

        "body": "Nowadays, social media platforms have become integral parts of our lives – and for an excellent reason.\n\nFrom chatting with their friends to reading the latest news to posting memes, social networks allow users to express themselves and communicate more efficiently in the digital world.\n\nHowever, in the last few years, the social media landscape showed its teeth, revealing numerous problems originating from the centralized operation of the solutions.\n\nIn this post, we will explore the dangers of centralized social networks as well as a possible solution to this burning issue.\n\n## **The Dangers of Centralized Social Networks**\n\nToday, the most popular social media solutions are operated by massive tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and ByteDance.\n\nDue to their centralized architecture, service providers have full control over the social networks' they manage.\n\nAs a result, they can set their own rules and exercise their authority to achieve various goals: for example, generate extra profit by selling user data to advertisers. For that reason, while social media is free to use in theory, you pay with your personal information to utilize the services. \n\nAnd, despite the fact that users power these platforms, social media giants extract value without distributing fair rewards to content creators.\n\nIn addition to data privacy scandals like Facebook's [infamous case](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html) with Cambridge Analytica, social media platforms face increased risks of cyberattacks. Storing user information on centralized servers creates a single point of failure, which means hackers have to exploit a vulnerability within only one part of the network to gain control of the whole system.\n\nIt's also crucial to talk about censorship, which has become a significant issue on traditional social media platforms. Due to their increased authority, providers can easily delete the posts, restrict the content, and ban users who share different views than theirs.\n\n## The Mission to Decentralize and Democratize Social Media\n\n[Subsocial](https://subsocial.network/) has identified the key issues of the social media landscape, which it aims to solve by leveraging blockchain technology and decentralization.\n\nUtilizing the Substrate blockchain framework, Subsocial built a robust social networking protocol that promotes decentralization and democracy.\n\nBy using IPFS for decentralized data storage, we eliminate the need for central servers, which enhances network security and eliminates all risks related to a single point of failure.\n\nWith the goal to end the status quo and challenge the increased power of tech giants, Subsocial follows the standards of Web 3.0 to offer users the ability to create the decentralized communities of tomorrow where they set and enforce their own rules via transparent on-chain moderation.\n\nIn fact, Subsocial just announced the launch of its first social dapp: Polkaverse.\n\n[Polkaverse](https://polkaverse.com/) is the first decentralized niche community for everything Polkadot and Kusama, where users can discuss the latest updates of the two platforms, the best projects within the ecosystem, and the hottest tokens without any irrelevant information.\n\nYou can learn more about Polkaverse and the future of Subsocial dApps by taking a look at the following article. [Meet Polkaverse: the First Decentralized Community for Everything Kusama and Polkadot](https://polkaverse.com/@subsocial/meet-polkaverse-the-first-decentralized-community-for-18564)\n\nDon't forget to [follow our blog](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial) to stay updated with the latest developments of our mission to decentralize and democratize the social media landscape.",

        "body": "We are very excited to announce the release of [Sub.ID](https://sub.id/), a complimentary service to Subsocial, and our gift to the Substrate ecosystem!\n\nAre you tired of having to slowly switch chains in the polkadot.js wallet to retrieve your addresses? Have you ever spent a day out at the park where you can't access the polkadot.js wallet, and you need your address for a specific chain, but don't have it saved in your phone? We've got you covered! With SubID, all you need to do is bookmark one page in your browser, and you can access your various Substrate wallet addresses from anywhere.\n\nAs an example of what you can see on Sub ID, check the account of Shawn: https://sub.id/#/12hAtDZJGt4of3m2GqZcUCVAjZPALfvPwvtUTFZPQUbdX1Ud\n\nSubID's uses go beyond just personal convenience. It will also aid in tipping people, as you can now easily tip someone in any token you want, without having to ask them for their address for that chain (as all you need to know is their address on any Substrate chain). In the future we will be adding a \"Send\" button to the SubID interface to further facilitate actions like this.\n\nHere's how it works: Your different addresses for all the different Substrate chains are essentially linked together, and your Polkadot address can be used to derive your Subsocial address, and your Kusama address, etc., and vice versa (the only exception is Moonriver/Moonbeam addresses — there is no way to convert them into the Substrate address format in order to derive the other addresses). Your address for any Substrate-based blockchain can be used to derive your address for every other Substrate-based blockchain. Pretty neat, huh? SubID leverages this to create a page that is able to show all the addresses of one account, just based off of a single address from any Substrate chain.\n\n## An Overview\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9YIDk3IIe706cEdbsaS2OQ.png)\n\nThis section summarizes your account, using the name, profile picture, and description you have set on Subsocial, as well as displaying your Substrate address, and a rough estimate of the total value of all your Substrate tokens in terms of $USD. In addition, there is a Follow button that will take you to their [Polkaverse](https://polkaverse.com/) page!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*5AHzB0K3pELl4Kfelw0F5A.png)\n\nThis section shows your address and token balance for various chains. Our development team has to add these manually, but we will eventually get all chains listed. The price column pulls the price from CoinGecko, and the last column shows the total $USD value of all your tokens. There is an option to hide chains that you do not possess any tokens for, as well as the ability to switch between the list view (shown above) and a grid view, depending on personal preference.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*AXwYMQphOoI-iez8v0AHyw.png)\n\nThis section simply pulls the data from your on-chain identity, if you have set one through the polkadot.js wallet. It will list every chain that you have set an identity on, and if you have received a judgement to have your identity verified, there will be a green circle around the chain's icon.\n\nWe hope the community will find this tool useful! A reminder to join us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SubsocialChain), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/w2Rqy2M), and [Telegram](https://t.me/Subsocial). We have also just added an email form to the front page of our [website](https://subsocial.network) if you would like to join our mailing list.\n\nHappy Subbing!",

But in reality, that's not the case.\n\nAs tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Twitter rule social media platforms, they leverage their increased authority to censor content, restrict accounts, and ban users who share different views from theirs.\n\nFurthermore, while the community keeps their solutions alive, service providers extract value without paying content creators their rightful rewards.\n\nSubsocial is on a mission to end this status quo with a decentralized and democratic social networking protocol that rewards users for creating awesome content.\n\nAnd now, we are excited to present [Polkaverse](https://polkaverse.com/), the first decentralized niche community for Polkadot and Kusama fans that launches as the first social dapp of the Subsocial multiverse.\n\n## What Is Polkaverse?\n\nPolkaverse leverages Subsocial's decentralized social networking protocol to launch an exclusive hub for all users who love Polkadot and Kusama.\n\nWith their communities scattered throughout multiple traditional social media platforms, the followers of the two sister ecosystems have long been struggling with increased censorship, the abundance of irrelevant information, and a lack of a dedicated decentralized platform.\n\nHowever, this is expected to change now.\n\nWith the launch of Polkaverse, Polkadot and Kusama fans can now engage in thoughtful conversations about a wide variety of topics, including the latest updates of the two platforms, the most promising projects within the ecosystem, and the hottest tokens on the market.\n\nAll this happens on a decentralized hub powered by Subsocial's robust protocol. As a result, Polkaverse members have complete control over how their data is utilized, and don't have to face the censorship of traditional social media platforms.\n\n## What Features Does Polkaverse Provide?\n\nPolkaverse is currently available as a web dapp, which you can access by [visiting the project's platform](https://polkaverse.com/) and signing in via your Subsocial account (or Polkadot wallet).\n\nBesides leveraging Subsocial's features, Polkaverse is integrated with Kusama to offer users additional functionalities, such as:\n\n* Access Kusama's on-chain identity module and fill user profile with details, such as name, email, social channels, and website addresses.\n* Inspect account roles in the Kusama network (validator, tech committee member, council member, etc.)\n\nHowever, this is only the start. The project is currently working on expanding its solution with additional features, including:\n\n* Introducing a special post type (with comments and notifications) that allows users to prepare Kusama Treasury proposals out of the box (this feature is being tested right now)\n* Integrating an on-chain identity module for Polkadot\n* Adding the option for users to see the verification status of accounts (on both Polkaverse and Subsocial)\n\n## This Is Only the Beginning\n\nLeveraging Subsocial's decentralized social networking protocol and a democratic community free from irrelevant information and tech giants’ censorship, Polkaverse is a no-brainer for Polkadot and Kusama fans.\n\nHowever, this is only the beginning.\n\nAs anyone is free to create his own dApp on top of Subsocial, more projects will launch soon on top of the Web 3.0 protocol to build the decentralized communities of tomorrow and challenge the overgrowing influence and authority of tech giants.\n\nBe sure to [follow Subsocial](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial) to stay updated about the latest developments of our fast-growing social networking multiverse.\n\n",

Subsocial will feature smart contract functionality, enabling the community to create their own SoFi primitives. The team is already building some, such as tipping and subscriptions. \n\nIt has always been important for creators to get paid for their work, but especially so in today's world. Equally as important is that content consumers be able to clearly and transparently decide which content deserves to be rewarded. Current content marketplaces suffer from too much interference by governing authorities and their algorithms, which impedes the smooth functioning of the content market.\n\nAdditionally, it is important, and morally imperative, that creators be rewarded for the full value of their work. Current content monetization platforms such as Youtube and Patreon take a cut out of the creator's pocket, and sometimes it is quite large - up to 20% or higher! While these companies are being paid for the value they provide with their platform, the future is now, and better alternatives exist.\n\nPlatforms now exist, such as Subsocial, that feature decentralized content monetization methods, and the reasons to rely on traditional platforms continue to diminish. There are lots of people that use Twitter, but very few that earn from it. Why shouldn't everyone get rewarded for the content they produce, however large or small it is?

You can think of it as a Page on Facebook, or a publication on Medium, or subreddit, or Twitter account, etc. Space is a flexible entity.\n\n## Roles and Permissions\nSubsocial consists of different blockchain modules. Currently there are about 10 of them. Let's looks at these two modules: Roles and Permissions. They can make your space more powerful. By using different Roles and Permissions in your space you can turn it into a Personal Blog or a Public Group. You can specify via settings who can post, comment, like in your space. Maybe only you can do it, or everyone else, or only followers. Or maybe a certain group of people defined by their account addresses on blockchain. It's up to you.\n\n## Ownership\nEvery space has an owner account. This means that this owner can be even be a multisig account. You may want to use such a feature if you are a co-founder of a project and you would like to share ownership of your project's space with your co-founders.\n\n## Transfer ownership\nYou can transfer an ownership of your space to another account. For example, you can use this feature to sell a space. Imagine you created a popular space where you or other pople write interesting posts. Then you decide to sell your space like poeple are selling domain names. You will find the \"transfer ownership\" feature helpful in such kind of situations. See how to transfer ownership of your space on Subsocial: [Transfer space ownership (new feature)](https://app.subsocial.network/@subsocial/transfer-space-ownership-new-feature-318).\n\n## And even more\nSome features are already implemented in blockchain and needs to have UI created for them. Some features are almost ready like Moderation module. And even more features are planned for spaces. For example we want to make a space look more similar to DAO with its own treasury and governance (maybe its simplified version). Stay tuned.",

        "body": "This living, evolving post details how gems work and what to expect in terms of activation. **Please read this document carefully.**\n\nNot all gems can be activated yet - implementing them requires some additional functionality which the RMRK team is currently building.\n\n**Some gems are single-use and are burned on use.** This is indicated in the descriptions below!\n\nWhen a certain gem can be activated, we will post on [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmrkapp), our [announcement Telegram](https://t.me/rmrk_ann), our [community Kanaria telegram](https://t.me/kanaria_official), and our [NFT telegram community](https://t.me/rmrkapp), as well as our [newsletter](https://news.nft.review) and the [blog](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp).\n\nNote that some gems in this list do not exist on the market because no bird rolled them in the initial hatching distribution. They will be available on the RMRK Gem marketplace in the near future.\n\n> ⚠ If you have **any** questions about the gems at any point, please reach out to the team [via email](mailto:gems@rmrk.app), or [via Telegram](https://t.me/kanaria_official).\n\n## How to obtain gems\n\nRMRK will add a gem shop soon where you will be able to use KSM, RMRK, and Voucher gems to obtain certain other gems for your bird(s). Some will only be obtainable with Vouchers, others with KSM/RMRK.\n\nIn the meanwhile, because gems are non-transferable, you buy them by buying the bird that owns the gem you want - the bird is the owner, and the gem travels with it. \n\nTo find all birds with a certain gem for sale, click on a gem's \"view all\" list (next to each heading in this post) and inspect the parent (container bird) of each gem to see if it's for sale. This searching process will be made much simpler soon, stay tuned.\n\n## A note on Gem Rarity\n\nMost of these gems have a **constant** maximum number. This means that as one Hermes is burned, another may appear on the marketplace after a delay. It is thus game-theoretically possible that someone hoards all Hermes and no more can be created (a totally legal monopoly). \n\n_Note: other gems might have a maximum minting supply total, so for example, if that's 250, then even if 250 have been burned, no more can be minted. The price of these might be placed on a curve, as in, the later a gem was made, the more expensive it is (in RMRK or KSM) until the last one is most expensive, but they will still cost 1 voucher (see below)._\n\nSome of the gems on the other hand will be minted in a slow, dripping fashion, e.g. five new Odals per month, purchasable for KSM, RMRK, or Vouchers. Mostly, we'll be coming up with new gems to put onto your birds.\n\n## Voucher gems (traits)\n\nVoucher gems (also known as _Traits_) can be redeemed for _some_ genesis gems from the list below (to be detailed on the gems marketplace when it launches), and for a variety of gems we've yet to add.\n\n> We originally called (and minted on-chain) all the Gems under the name Traits. We apologize for the confusion - the names are interchangeable.\n\nThe gem mechanics will extend long into the future of RMRK and Kanaria and into related metaverses, will have featured partnerships, and more. There will be a dedicated gem marketplace on [Kanaria](https://kanaria.rmrk.app) which will allow purchashing them with RMRK, KSM, or Vouchers, but a large part of gems will only be redeemable for vouchers. Notably, new mints of Genesis-level gems like Caishen and similar.\n\nThe Vouchers will also be usable for new items we'll launch in the future. These items will be tradable, unlike gems.\n\n## Bragi ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=bragi)) ✅ ACTIVE\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RtLC8SU.png)\n\nThe Bragi gem allows you to upload custom artwork to your bird. Since all RMRK NFTs are multi-resource, they can have different outputs. For example, if you check [Bird 0001](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue/8949162-e0b9bdcc456a36497a-KANBIRD-KANS-00000001), you will notice it looks different. This is because it has three different resources: a beautiful cyberpunk illustration by Paola Tuazon, a movie of a statuette, and the rendered SVG bird.\n\nThe owner of a multi-resource NFT can define the rendering priority - which one of these is shown first. By changing your priority to be something other than the SVG render, you make your bird stand out without sacrificing any functionality (your Njordson gems, item boosts for metaverse etc. stay active).\n\nThe Bragi gem is already manually usable. Please contact us via [gems@rmrk.app](mailto:gems@rmrk.app) to get your secondary artwork approved (we will filter profanity, copyright infringement, and unrelated / unappropriate art), and we'll follow up with instructions.\n\n> Note that commissioning art for this is the Bragi user's responsibility. RMRK will merely issue a transaction which will propose a new resource to the NFT owner. The NFT owner then has to accept the additional visual.\n\n- **🔥 A Bragi gem is burned on use.** \n\n## Odal ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=odal))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SGf7qPX.png)\n\nOdal allows the owner to apply a name to their bird. This can be re-applied if the owner obtains another Odal later on, allowing for name changes. A named bird will no longer be called \"Bird 0031\", but something the gem's user chooses, like \"Mr. Featherfluff\" or, if you got a sponsorship deal, \"Coca Cola bird\".\n\n- **🔥 An Odal gem is burned on use.** \n\n## Kokopelli ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=kokopelli))  ✅ ACTIVE\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v4kpySl.png)\n\nEarly-access gem lets you in on private sales (if any) of upcoming projects launching on or with RMRK.\n\nAt any given time, RMRK will have access to information about upcoming projects, partners that want to build on our stack, or even NFT projects from outside the space. This gem lets you use that \"alpha\". \n\nIn the case of RMRK partner projects, you can even get in on the ground floor on a priority basis, so invest in a seed round or be granted first right of purchase in case of very popular collections.\n\nOnce you take advantage of an alpha - whether you end up investing or not - your Kokopelli is used up and you need to get another one to be notified of new opportunities.\n\nTo activate your Kokopelli, please [contact us](gems@rmrk.app). The process is as follows:\n\n- subscribe to [NFT Review](https://news.nft.review)\n- keep an eye out for \"Kokopelli\" in the newsletter, which will mention that RMRK has some \"alpha\" available\n- If this alpha seems interesting, **and you have had your kokopelli equipped for the last 30 days**, [email us](mailto:gems@rmrk.app).\n- We will then require you to burn your Kokopelli in order to be given more information. The RMRK team will facilitate and guarantee early access to this opportunity, should you choose to use it. Whether you participate in this alpha after being given more information or not, your Kokopelli is used up.\n\n> A note on \"doxing\": while a kokopelli gem does require you to reach out via email so we can communicate, this email can be anon as all we care about is your ability to cryptographically prove you own a Kokopelli bird. This is all doable anonymously.\n\n- **🔥 A Kokopelli gem is burned on use.**\n\n## Daikoku ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=daikoku)) / Daikokuchan ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=daikokuchan)) / Daikokuchanchan ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=daikokuchanchan))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DYrHXz1.png)\n\nOnce RMRK 2.0 NFTs launch on [Singular.rmrk.app](https://singular.rmrk.app), there will be a commission applied. This gem and its lesser siblings remove this commission from Singular, either forever, or for a time period.\n\n_Note: buyer pays commission on RMRK, not seller._\n\nThe release of RMRK 2.0 functionality on Singular is planned for Q4.\n\n- **💎 A Daikoku gem is active while equipped.**\n- **🔥 A Daikokuchan gem is burned on use.**\n- **🔥 A Daikokuchanchan gem is burned on use.**\n\n## Caishen ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=caishen))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SoJoTNo.png)\n\nWith a growing diversity of media types and ever increasing sizes of files which, with the advent of RMRK 2, can also be nested and contain multiple files at once, hosting users' NFT resources on IPFS and pinning them globally via commercial services and our own nodes is becoming more and more expensive.\n\nFor that reason, as soon as RMRK 2.0 is enabled on the [Singular.rmrk.app](https://singular.rmrk.app) marketplace, a hosting fee will be applied to new mints based on the size of their resources. The minimum will be $1. For a large collection of, say, 5000 NFTs whic also have different resources, this can rapidly snowball.\n\nHaving this gem equipped in an owned bird completely frees the owner account from paying this fee, within an acceptable range as deemed by RMRK (e.g. you cannot delegate / sell this on, that's considered abuse. You also cannot use us as your personal cloud storage.)\n\n- **💎 This gem is active while equipped.**\n\n## Caerus Prime ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=caerus_prime)) / Caerus 2 ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=caerus_2)) / Caerus 3 ([view all](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?symbol=caerus_3))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kySyuXr.png)\n\nLootboxes are sets of random standalone NFTs compatible with Kanaria. This means you can get gems, equippables, and even fungible tokens randomly in a lootbox of a certain type.\n\n- **🔥 A Caerus Prime / 2 / 3 gem is burned on use.**\n\n## Hermes\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5JeIj9Z.png)\n\nFree access to all RMRK online and in-person events, for as long as you have it equipped.\n\n- **💎 A Hermes gem is active while equipped.**\n\nCan also be activated (burned) as a one-time voucher for the VIP entry, hotel lodging and reasonable travel cost reimbursement (as deemed by the RMRK association and subject to individual approval) to any in-person RMRK-organized public event. If you would like to use this gem in this way, please first [contact us](mailto:gems@rmrk.app).\n\n- **🔥 A Hermes gem is burned on use.**\n\n## Njord / Njordson\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aDvvHRs.png)\n\nThe coveted Njord and Njordson gems give the wearer a part of RMRK's revenue for life of the blockchain, project, company, crystal, or bird - whichever dies first. Njord gives 0.5%, Njordson gives 0.1%. The total for all gems of this type was supposed to be 20%, but 3 founders never hatched their eggs, so those Njordsons died with their birds. The total amount of team revenue that will be shared is therefore 19.7%. But revenue of _what_?\n\nRMRK has several sources of revenue:\n\n- staking the egg sale treasury\n- staking from the multi-sig (HKKT5DjFaUE339m7ZWS2yutjecbUpBcDQZHw2EF7SFqSFJH)\n- commission and royalties from Singular, Kanaria, and other projects (deposited into the multi-sig)\n- partner programs and launches, charged as a service fee or a sale commission\n- item and gem launches on Kanaria\n\nFuture potential income includes but is not limited to:\n\n- consulting for other NFT projects and platforms\n- building alternative revenue-focused apps and platforms like a dedicated auction house site\n- metaverse land sale\n- etc.\n\nOur expenses, like infrastructure, salaries, legal, contractors, art, and so on, are all paid from the egg sale treasury.\n\nOnce per month - typically in the first week of the month - a report will be published, accessible only by accounts that hold birds which have Njord or Njordson **equipped**. The gem **must be equipped for the entire duration of the month**. The gem's \"cost\" is one less gem slot, so it must be consistently equipped.\n\n> Note: we will void this always-on requirement for the month of September 2021, due to these instructions being published well into the month.\n\nThis _Njordson Report_ will be accessible via the main navigation on [Kanaria.rmrk.app](https://kanaria.rmrk.app), or direct link access at [Kanaria.rmrk.app/report](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/report). To be informed when a new Njordson Report has been published, follow [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmrkapp), our [announcement Telegram](https://t.me/rmrk_ann), our [community Kanaria telegram](https://t.me/kanaria_official), or our [NFT telegram community](https://t.me/rmrkapp), as well as our [newsletter](https://news.nft.review) and the [blog](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp).\n\nThe profits of the multi-sig's staking, commission, and royalties are what Njord and Njordson holders are entitled to. This means 19.7% of:\n\n- all commission and royalties from both Singular and Kanaria\n- all sales profits from RMRK-launched items and gems\n- all staking profits on the multi-sig (to be turned into a validator soon)\n- 20% of staking profits on the treasury's stake\n\nIf you approximate just 1% of Opensea's volume on Singular / Kanaria within 12 months, that's 33 million in volume per month, or 1155 USD for every Njordson (0.1%) holder. This is from commissions alone, not counting sales and staking profits. For reference, in two weeks of its life, [Kanaria alone did 1.4 million USD in volume](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/sales).\n\nThe commission is paid out in the currency it was earned, regardless of relative dollar value. An item paid with 100 RMRK is 5 RMRK in earnings, regardless of RMRK value, so Njord/son holders get the proportional amount of RMRK.\n\n- **💎 This gem is active while equipped.**\n\n### Claiming\n\nDistribution is automatic, in the first week of every month (usually on the 2nd, but might be later depending on holidays, weekends, etc.). Distribution is manual for now, becuase we have no smart contracts. Once smart contracts are up, we'll make a simple withdraw contract and automate the earnings claims.\n\nThe first distribution is happening on October 4th.\n\n### What if there's an \"exit\"?\n\nWe won't pretend we're able to resist any and all temptation. If a protocol or company comes in and offers each of us co-founders 10 million and another 20 million for the rest of the team to divide to absorb our tech, brand, and products into their suite, we'll think about it. [It's not without precedent](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/13/polygon-merges-with-hermez-network-in-250m-deal/). \n\nThe protocol will remain and stay open source for others to hack on, but we could probably be bribed out of working on this, NGL. In that case, we commit to each putting 20% of our personal profit from such a deal towards a Njord/son treasury. The gem holders effectively become the fifth co-founder to exit with us. Just putting this out there to be clear on the terms in advance and avoid drama in the unlikely edge case this happens.",

        "body": "On September 15th 2021, the RMRK token was minted and distributed to all eggdopters according to a July 1st snapshot.\n\n## How to see my balance\n\nTo check how many you should have gotten vs your actual balance, please refer to the [fairdrop](https://url.rmrk.app/utility) post and compare with your original number of purchased eggs.\n\nYou can see your balance by visiting [Singular](https://) or [Kanaria]() and checking out the header. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HQWbiuk.png)\n\nAlternatively, you can check the Polkadot JS UI interface [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-statemine-rpc.paritytech.net#/assets/balances). You must use the dropdown to select asset 8 (RMRK) and this UI will then show you all of your accounts that have some balance of this token.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2UgLACN.png)\n\nPlease note that because the token is minted on the Statemine chain, you **must be connected to the Statemine chain** to read it and interact with it.\n\nOther wallets and interfaces that can show you the RMRK token balance:\n\n- [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/)\n- [Dotmarketcap](https://dotmarketcap.com/myportfolio)\n- [Mathwallet](https://mathwallet.xyz)\n\n> 🚨 Please understand that you will **never** see your token balance in the Polkadot JS extension. The extension is just a signer, a set of crypto keys that allow access to your accounts. It does not know or care about chains, because it just stores math (cryptographic access to your accounts). As such, please use one of the above methods to see your balance.\n\n## Total supply / distribution / vesting / buyback\n\n88% of the tokens were distributed to the community who bought eggs.\n\nThe total supply is 10 million tokens. There is no inflation.\n\nOut of the 11% remaining tokens, 5% are locked for the founding team and the rest is loaned out to market makers for exchange liquidity.\n\nThere is no buyback program due to the immense [utility](https://url.rmrk.app/utility) of the token across the RMRK ecosystem.\n\n## How to send the token\n\nTo send the token, use any of the wallets above, or you can use the same Polkadot JS UI you use for reading the balance. The same table will show a \"Send\" button next to any address that can send the tokens.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5PDKROz.png)\n\nPlease note that the recipient **MUST** have at least the existential deposit amount of KSM in their account. **You cannot send tokens to dead accounts**. 0.005 KSM is enough.\n\nYou also need to have KSM in the account doing the sending. You already do have some - we gave you some KSM so your account comes to life and can accept the tokens. If you want to top this up, you need to Teleport some KSM from Kusama into Statemine. You can do that by going to Accounts -> Teleport in the [Kusama UI](http://kusama.dotapps.io), and teleporting into Statemine.\n\n## How to trade the token\n\nThere is currently no way to trade the token. If any exchange, dex or cex, offers to trade the token and is NOT listed here as an official partner, they **are most certainly trying to scam you**.\n\nThe RMRK Association does not recommend engaging in OTC trades either - please wait for the token to be tradable in the very near future. \n\n**⚠ The first CEX to list this token will be Kucoin, which will happen in September 2021.**\n\n## How to use the token\n\nAs [documented earlier](https://url.rmrk.app/utility), the RMRK token will have plenty of utility across the ecosystem - both as the native currency of the RMRK protocol and metaverse, and as a currency on the Singular website and other products we (the RMRK team) build and launch. Additionally, the RMRK token will be added as collateral to various DeFi ecosystems and into various DEX pools.\n\nRight now, however, the token has no such functionality yet - it's coming in the very near future.\n\n## What about my tokens on Kucoin?\n\nIf you were entitled to any tokens via Kucoin, those tokens will be unlocked for you **on Kucoin** when trading begins because the tokens are distributed based on the eggholder snapshot on July 1st, and at that time all the Kucoin eggs were with Kucoin. \n\nThe RMRK team has no control over this aspect of token deployment, and it would be best if you contact Kucoin's support about this matter, or wait for the listing to start.\n\n## My balance doesn't match what I expected\n\nPlease contact us via [hello@rmrk.app](mailto:hello@rmrk.app) and we'll try to get to the bottom of it asap.",

        "body": "On this episode of RAS, we switched things up a bit. Given that almost everyone associates NFTs with visual art, we were delighted to find an artist who pushed the boundaries of this mainstream definition. NFTs can be more than visual art, they can also be music, and this is what our spotlight artist for the week is showing with his work. **Fr.om** is a music artist who minted and sold out an EP of 5 songs as a collection on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/c8205518d881699b3e-%F0%9F%93%A1).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vqstrAy.jpg)\n\nHis music can be described as Drumfunk, a style of Drum and Bass that blends other abstract and ambient music. Majority of the tracks are melancholy collages of noise, heavily processed samples, and atmospherics driven by broken break beats and heavy sub. In short, it's music to be experienced.\n\nRead the interview below to see the NFT world from a music artist's point of view. \n\n---\n\n**RMRK: Can you tell us a little bit about you how started your career in music?**\n\n**Fr.om:** \n> It all started more than ten years ago. Initially, it was just a hobby like computer games or cycling. But during this time, I began to go deeper and deeper and fall in love with this process and as a result I bought a lot of synthesizers and  there was no turning back (laugh)\n\n**RMRK: That’s pretty cool. I think we can all think of a hobby that became something more. How’d you get into NFTs?**\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> As usual - friends suggested the existence of crypto currencies and at first it was trading on the exchange. Later I learned about the existence of nft as a digital product and its sale and purchase.\n\n**RMRK: NFTs — historically at least — have been commonly used for digital art. What inspired you to try music?** \n\n**Fr.om:**\n> Seeing that NFT is based only on visual projections, I realized that it would be good to become a pioneer and pave the way for the audio format.\n\n**RMRK: It does seem like people are liking the innovation. Do you have a favorite project that you’ve worked on?**\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> The last project I converted to nft was one of my favorites. I worked on it for a long time, implemented the conceived ideas and looked for a good use for it.\n\n\n**RMRK: What was the creative process like?**\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> First I flipped through a lot of old records from the 70s-80s. I found the sounds I needed and recorded them into apparatuses (samplers). Next comes the magic of sound processing, the addition of foreign synthesizer sounds and drums. All this is accompanied by arrangements and sometimes live vocals. After a while, a composition is obtained, I show it to my friends and wife, and by the general verdict we decide whether to show it to the world.\n\n\n**RMRK: Which are your favorite records to get inspiration from?**\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> All jazz, funk and avant-garde from the past, preferably on vinyl.\n\n\n**RMRK:** What can we expect you next from you in the NFT space?\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> The next release will be more assertive and experimental. If the past was more classic, now it will be an innovation with the shades of the past.\n\n**RMRK:** How do you feel the future of NFTs will look like?\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> I think that now we are at the very beginning of the path and the future will be very unpredictable. Probably the most unpredictable implementations should be expected.\n\n**RMRK: What would be the one thing you’d add to an NFT platform if you could?**\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> Maybe it wouldn't hurt the way of marketing. The assistant who promoted your product. Artists know how to create a product, but they often don't know how to promote it.\n\n**RMRK: Have you thought of any interesting ways to use RMRK2.0 in your future collections?**\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> It seems to me that RMRK 2.0 can try the idea with poetry and written thoughts. (Maybe hiphop rap or something.) Where the idea is to combine visual production with audio to get a new product.\n> Another idea is to create sample packs of sounds and make a new original compositions from it. Combine vocal acapella and music without vocal (minus).\n\n**RMRK: What can we expect from you in the NFT space?**\n\n**Fr.om:**\n> The next release will be more assertive and experimental. If the past was more classic, now it will be an innovation with the shades of the past.\n\n---\nWe had an interesting conversation with Fr.om and are looking forward to more music NFTs from him. To catch up with Fr.om's upcoming releases, follow him on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/fr-om) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nonemyc/).\n\nWe are pretty excited about music NFTs and [RMRK 2.0](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/dawn-of-the-art-legos-18289). With the nesting functionality (NFTs ownig other NFTs), a music NFT (mp3) can own another NFT that is the publishing license (PDF). Using multi-resource functionality, a song NFT can have the following resources:\n1. A high-quality mp3 version for playback in streaming platforms like Audius.\n2. A music video in mp4 for playback in video-enabled enviroments\n3. An VR animated lyric video for playback in VR-enabled enviroments.\n4. A pdf of the lyrics that shows up in pdf-enabled enviroments.\n\nWith the forward compatibility functionality, new versions of songs (like remixes or alternate versions) can be sent to the original music NFT or added as a new resource. In short, the possibilities are endless and we look forward to seeing more music artists push the envelope further.\n\n---\n**Are you a talented digital artist?

[Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/), our flagship NFT marketplace for Kusama and Polkadot, is one such product. Below are the changes and updates we’ve made recently.\n\n## Statemine Support\nNow you can view and interact with all NFTs minted on Statemine, Kusama’s first common good parachain for minting fungible and non-fungible tokens. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/48cHXL0.png)\n\n**To view Statemine NFTs** change the network in the top right corner of Singular. By default, it's set to Kusama. \n\n## Plagiarism Warning and Blacklisting\n\nWith the growing rise of plagiarism in the NFT ecosystem, and on Singular, we have implemented a Plagiarism warning system that warns users when they are interacting with work by an author suspected of plagiarism or copyright or trademark infringement. \n\nAny artwork marked as plagiarized will be removed from the Singular homepage (if it was there before), but will still be accessible via direct link.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gHOv8Me.png)\n\n**It’s important to note that** this update doesn’t fully protect buyers from engaging with plagiarized works because it’s currently a manual system. This means that a work is only marked as plagiarized when the RMRK team has (1) found the work and (2) researched to find its plagiarism status. It’s very possible that we could miss some artworks and so you are encouraged to do your due diligence.\n\n## Improved double buy protective measures\n\nWe improved the double buy prevention mechanism with an added delay and check for NFT availability before issuing a transaction. More work is in the pipeline in this area for the next 4 weeks. Additionally, as we transition to smart contracts and pallets in the near future, this problem will be removed entirely.\n\n---\n\nGo ahead and test out these new features. Also, if you have any ideas or requests, feel free to reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/rmrkapp), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bV9kQbVC99), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmrkapp).

        "body": "The RMRK team is proud to announce the public release of the first RMRK 2.0 collection. \n\nThis also marks the release of the most advanced NFTs in the world, and the immediate availability of trading on the [Kanaria item and bird catalog](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/catalogue?nftType=birds).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zv8foYD.png)\n\n## Soft Launch\n\nLast week, we stealthily launched the birds and items in full, allowing anyone to hatch their birds (actually get them out of their shells). This allowed every egg owner to open the egg and reveal the bird and all of the NFT the bird owns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hjbnXzH.gif)\n\n*Please note that on-chain this info is already visible, and there's no randomness / booster pack logic applied. This is just a cover animation that makes revealing fun. Selling a bird that is \"unopened\" this way does not mean the contents are secret.*\n\nSince the beginning of September, bird owners have been able to equip and unequip items on their birds:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UrMJpT9.png)\n\n... and it has also been possible to set a secondary resource as a priority for those birds that have secondary art. This lead to a beautifully diverse set.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7osymqF.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/icCPM6S.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ut6FUAF.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9MH6U7L.jpg)\n\nWe look forward to letting you discover all the wonderful founder art our artists have produced as more birds are revealed!\n\n## Trading Launch\n\nAs promised, we launched trading. This means that starting Sept 6th, you could list your birds and/or items for sale on [Kanaria.rmrk.app](https://kanaria.rmrk.app).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rsWbYWf.png)\n\nThe following caveats are worth keeping in mind:\n\n- gems are non-transferable. Think of them as \"soulbound\" to the bird.\n- selling a bird will also sell all of its child items. This includes non-transferable gems, they can travel with the bird they belong to (2).\n- to send an item from a bird's inventory into your main inventory, click the \"Move to Nest\" button on an item (3).\n- to send an item you have into a bird, click the \"Add To\" button (1) and then start typing into the \"Bird Serial Number\" box (2) to get a list of birds you can send this to:\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/9nxzVF1.png)\n\n  \nThink of your Nest as your general inventory. Inside that inventory you have birds and items. Birds can also contain items, i.e. every bird also has its own inventory. Items can be in the birds, or in your inventory, but you can only sell them if they're in your inventory or if they're in a bird that is not for sale itself.\n\n*Listing a bird that has its items listed for sale will cancel the listings of those items. Listing an item that belongs to a parent that's for sale is not possible and will fail, per RMRK specification.*\n\n## Partners and Referral Birds?\n\nWhat about partners and referral birds?\n\nYour referrals will be visible on the bird cards in the catalogue:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GkTrfQV.png)\n\n... or in the details of a bird:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pwtml8I.png)\n\nThis mark indicates that this bird is eligible to recieve a partner item, but HAS NOT received one yet. Once it does, this item will be in the bird's inventory like any other item, and this icon will disappear from the bird.\n\nSo when are these items coming?\n\nWe're talking to all our partners about minting them, and helping them get it out the door, but as you can imagine most of them are busy launching, crowdloaning, etc. We will issue updates here on the blog, and in the [announcement channel](https://t.me/rmrk_ann), and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmrkapp), and in the [newsletter](https://news.nft.review) whenever one of the items has been distributed.\n\n## Gems\n\nAll birds have been hatched with the maximum number of gems available. That is, super late hatches might be penalized to the max, and have 0 gems, and 0 gem slots. This means they will never be able to equip gems and traits.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y5zkOQ7.png)\n\nOthers will have the number of gem slots matching their rarity level (for Limited Edition eggs this was 3 slots), but potentially also penalized if hatching late.\n\n**All birds that have healthy gem slots also have the same number of gems in their inventory**.\n\nSo when you're looking at birds on the marketplace, if you see some gems \"empty\", like in the image below, that does not mean this bird only has 1 gem. It means it only has 1 gem equipped, but the other 2 are in its inventory. Inspect it to learn more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E8Ps4Cc.png)\n\n*Tip: to prevent your bird from appearing less valuable than other birds, it is recommended you equip all the gems you have, by going into the inventory, selecting a gem and a slot to equip into, and saving.*\n\n## What's Next?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zv8foYD.png)\n\nIn the immediate future, we'll release:\n\n- drastic improvements to inventory UX based on user feedback.\n- add stats like sale volume, floor info, and more. This will go onto the (currently very basic) [sales](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/sales) page.\n- monitor RMRK 2.0 features on Kanaria and port over to Singular whatever graduates on Kanaria. Kanaria is, in many ways, the \"Kusama\" for Singular - we're using it to test RMRK 2.0 in production.\n\nIn parallel, we're planning:\n\n- a hackathon in October to incentivize creation of helper tools and an ecosystem around Kanaria.\n- a detailed post on how gems work, when they become active, and how to use them.\n- a rewrite of RMRK logic as both pallets and smart contracts, giving users the option of using something like Moonriver, or something like a parachain that will integrate our pallets.\n- a metaverse project around Kanaria birds.\n\nMore info on all of these coming throughout September. Stay tuned and follow us on [the blog](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp), [the newsletter](https://news.nft.review), [the announcement channel](https://t.me/rmrk_ann), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/rmrkapp).\n\n### Live Demo\n\n[![](https://crowdcast-prod.imgix.net/-MXXx9v7MQJkqPS47zbR/event-cover-9167?w=800)](https://url.rmrk.app/kanariacc)\n\nEverything above is also being demonstrated **live** during [this crowdcast](https://url.rmrk.app/kanariacc), and will be multi-streamed to RMRK's Youtube channel!

        "body": "In the past month, we’ve noticed a significant uptrend in new artists and collectors on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/). We are particularly happy to see increased sales for artists. However, we are deeply disturbed by some of the activities going on and so we’ve written this post to address them. First, we’ll begin with the main issues.\n\n#### 1. Blatant Plagiarism\nAny self-respecting artist will never plagiarize (copy) another person’s work or even theirs. To do so is to become an art thief and that’s depressing. \n\n#### 2. Stylish Plagiarism\nSome people (we were gonna call them artists but true artists don’t steal directly) believe that making a few modifications to a piece of art makes it less plagiarized. Well, that’s wrong. Copying a 2D artwork into 3D doesn’t make it a new piece of art. It has still been stolen.\n\nWe want our artists to drink from the freedom offered by NFTs, we want them to be happy and rich. Hence, we have outlined these few best practices.\n\n## Singular Best practices - for artists\n1. **Don’t remint pieces that you’ve already sold** — this should go without saying. By minting a piece as a 1/1 and selling it, you are giving the collector the glorious feeling of owning your art. When you remint this piece (either on Singular or another platform), you are essentially stealing from the collector who loved your work enough to give you money for it. How would you feel if you were in the same shoes?\n2. **Make it clear to buyers how many times you’ll remint a piece if you’ll be reminting it** — in the case that you believe your art is too valuable or good to be minted only once, it is only fair and sensible to inform the collectors ahead of time. You can simply do this by adding the information to the description of the piece when you mint (the first time as well as all other times). It’s about trust. By doing this, your collectors will have more trust in you and hence, you will get more sales.\n3. **Don’t mint other people's work** — this is straight-up stealing. Please, do not do this. However, you can mint another person’s work if they have given the permission/rights to mint it. \n4. **If you’re going to mint multiples of an item consider making it a collection** -- i.e. 1/40 of a duplicated piece so people can know how rare it is\n5. **Don’t start collections you don’t plan on finishing** (finish what you started) — if not, collectors who bought from you the first time will not buy again, believing that you’re incompetent, or worse, a fraud.\n6. **Add a link to your portfolio or project website** — this helps people to see your past work. It's never a bad idea to give people more art to browse. \n7. **Add an identity and contact information** — this helps to prove your legitimacy as a human being. Futher, people are more open to buying from artists that they can contact (if they wanted to).\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities for artists to make it in the NFT space. Being dishonest is the quickest way to ruin your chances. If you're struggling with how to release an artwork, feel free to reach out to the community on Telegram. Also, read our interview with artists who have already launched successfully on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/), you'll be sure to learn a trick or two.\n* [Ahmedov and His Kusama Skulls](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-artist-spotlight-13-ahmedov-and-his-kusama-skulls-19512)\n* [Code and His Ku Collection](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-artist-spotlight-12-code-and-his-ku-collection-19221) ⭐︎\n* [Rubentopia and His Isometric Worlds](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-artist-spotlight-11-ruben-topia-and-his-isometric-19131)\n* [Thomas Jerrykson and His Cult Movie Series](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-artist-spotlight-10-thomas-jerrykson-and-his-cult-19068)\n\n",

        "body": "On this episode of RAS, we caught up with **Ahmedov**, the creator of [Kusama Skulls](https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/9692fa834afcce2d3e-FYKMX), a collection of 31 skulls grouped into 3 rarity levels--Bronze, Silver, and Gold. The collection sold out and some pieces are now being relisted, with the highest listing price at 10 KSM (~$3,000 as of this writing.)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IjYSbm7.png)\n\n\nWe are particularly impressed with Ahmedov's work because of his style diversity. A trip through his Instagram page brims with visual variety,spanning multiple visual dimensions. It's always nice to meet an artist that's capable of more than one kind of style.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RIEvyeI.jpg)\n\n\nWe spoke about his journey into NFTs, his favorite project, where he finds inspiration, and more. Read the interview below.\n\n---\n\n\n### Q: How did you start your art career?\n**Ahmedov**\n> I began to draw as soon as I learned to hold a pencil in my hand (since childhood). After graduating from school, I decided that I needed to buy a tablet and plunged into the world of digital drawing. Drawing attracted me more than playing computer games or watching a movie. I spent all my pocket money on materials for creativity - then, I had no idea that drawing would be with me all my life!\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Ahmedov**\n> I learned about NFT more than a year ago, but for me it was all incomprehensible. I just watched from the sidelines. A week ago, my friend Vova ([Thomas Jerrykson](https://www.instagram.com/thomas_jerrykson/)) literally forced me to publish my work on the site. I didn’t believe there would be sales, but the morning after publication I woke up rich (laughs).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f6bS2i6.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: Tell us about your favorite project that you've worked on and why.\n**Ahmedov**\n> All my projects are like children to me (choose a favorite, others will be offended). That said, my most interesting project is a voxel-based game. The client came to me with a guarantee and I began to study the tool for creating this project. I love to try something new for myself. \n\n\n### Q: NFTs have provided accessibility and exposure to various forms of digital creations. Do you have new artists that you follow and what do you find interesting about them?\n**Ahmedov**\n> One of the first creators who started my acquaintance with the NFT world was brickspacer, a motion designer from Russia. I like that there is humor in his works, subtle attention to detail, appeal! Over time, I noticed how more and more artists I follow on Instagram exhibited their work. The list is too long to name all. Everyone has their own unique style, which I enjoy.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S89nZzS.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What is your creative process like?\n**Ahmedov**\n> Every day I replenish my visual base by browsing Behance, Pinterest, Instagram, and Twitter. I also love to watch movies. It charges me with some kind of emotion. \n> While watching a movie, I take my drawing tools (pen and sheets or iPad) and just sketch faces, robots, skulls until I fill the entire page and put it in a drawer. Over time, a mountain of scribbled paper accumulates, which needs to be disassembled. I take pictures of the pieces I like and draw them digitally. \n> \n> If we are talking about a commercial order, I first of all collect references, read articles, watch videos on the topic and draw right away in digital form (this is easier to edit - the paper does not have ctrl + z).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5h6KtWs.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What are your inspiration(s)?\n**Ahmedov**\n> The world. It could be anything. A conversation with an interesting person, walks with friends, food, an interesting video. But most often these are films.\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**Ahmedov**\n> Earn money for my apartment (just kidding). \n> \n> To be honest, I don’t know. I just paint and am happy that it resonates with my followers and collectors!\n\n\n### Q: How do you see the NFT space shaping up?\n**Ahmedov**\n> I think NFT will only grow! For me, this is a new round of art. We can say that this is a new Renaissance!\n\n\n### Q: What would you most like an NFT platform to have?\n**Ahmedov**\n> More artists, more collectors!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5TytGRY.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q: What exciting new stuff can we look forward to from you, and where can people find you?\n**Ahmedov**\n>I am preparing several series of skulls. There will be a multiverse. In some series of works I will use animation and 3D. Follow my social media accounts to stay updated--[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ahmdv_art), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ahmedov_art/), and [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/FykMxr2d2MEGizLbs9hGGCiEb5nrgTHvHmWo3GSJ3xrEHJ6?page=1&tab=created&creator=true). \n\n---\nIt was a brief but illuminating chat with Ahmedov. He is the third artist we have interviewed who only got into NFTs because their close friends forced them. We are grateful to Thomas for bringing Ahmedov to Singular because we are excited to see what he puts out in the coming years. \n\n\n\n**If you have a friend who's a talented artist, we would like you to know that it is unfair to not have told them about NFTs or Singular. Come on, you can do better. We even make it easy for you by offering your talented friend a [sponsored trial of Singular worth 500 FREE MINTS](https://url.rmrk.app/form)!** \n",

        "body": "In this week's episode of Artist Spotlight, we caught up with **Code**, the creator of the [Ku Collection](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/EtF8MpQPXrqAtrwvuE6Ni4BvBMNPMXyxTug6WkzuV5utB1e?page=1&tab=created&creator=true), a fun collection of NFT birds whose designs are heavily inspired by some of pop culture's most memorable characters, animals, moods, etc.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vykl0aK.jpg)\n\n\n*Speaking for myself (as [gbaci](https://twitter.com/gbaciX)), the Ku Collection is hands-down my favorite NFT collection at the moment. The primary reason is my appreciation for the happy marriage of the idea (using one template to reflect many aspects of our reality) and clean execution. That said, **this isn't buying advice as I don't own any**.*\n\nRead on for our interview where we discuss Code's journey into art and crypto, his thoughts on the NFT space, his inspirations, and much more. In particular, crypto artists looking to release their own collections could learn a thing or two from Code's perspective on what it takes to create a successful project. \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Q: How did you start your art career?\n**Code:**\n> Well, I’ve never actually considered art as a real career path until reading this question, at this very moment. I started creating as a toddler. I doodled all the time. I’ve always found creating to be a place of zen where my imagination was better than my experienced reality. Growing up was a little rough and it was a form of escape. I would get ‘in the zone’, and I’d look up to discover that hours have passed by. I have no official training as an artist. Well, besides a high school computer art class. Even saying that I’m an artist sounds strange to me. Initially, I began creating because I am an introvert, and this was a comfortable outlet for my vast imagination and ideas. It started with memes. Then I started dabbling in photo manipulation in Photoshop. I recommend Photoshop on IPad for anyone that wants to begin because the tools are streamlined and you have the Apple Pencil. Youtube was my teacher. Any problem I needed to solve with compositing an image I just typed it on youtube. How do I blend this guy with the background? ...Youtube. How do I extract this hair? … YouTube.\n\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Code:**\n> Blockchain and the entire crypto market have ultimately brought me into NFT’s. It was the market crash of 2017 that motivated me to learn everything I could about this new space and the emerging decentralized technologies. I spent years studying technical analysis.  Losing a lot of money tends to motivate people. I also tried NFT’s before with no success. It wasn’t until singular and the Ku Collection that things started clicking.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hM3c3vv.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: Tell us about your favorite project that you've worked on and why.\n**Code:**\n> Honestly, the Ku Collection NFT project is by far the most fulfilling. Being able to create a sense of value and also build a community is where it’s at. Feeling the excitement from people and being a part of something that we are all invested in, is so worth it.\n\n\n### Q: NFTs have provided accessibility and exposure to various forms of digital creations. Do you have new artists that you follow and what do you find interesting about them?\n**Code:**\n> I don’t really follow any too closely as it is all still so new but the crypto punks project initially got my attention. Only because it confused me. Like what? I had no idea why anyone would pay that much money for a few pixels. Sometimes I think I know why, but then I don’t again. A few other artists are popping up in the community, but we will wait and see what they create.\n\n### Q: What is your creative process like?\n**Code:**\n> Ok, I can break down my creative process into 3 main parts: \n> 1. Concept - Organizing the overall idea, the focus, and the overall shot. \n> 2. Assets - Simply finding the pieces needed with correct angles, lighting, color, etc.\n> 3. Execution - Overall flow, mood, and inspiration.\n\n> If any of these parts are off then the project doesn’t usually get completed. Actually, I have about 4 partly created KU’s already that never made it to the wild. Simply because one of these creative parts was off. Sometimes I have to start my entire project over. This happened with my City of Elon NFT project. I basically made it twice.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R4m3Nmf.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What are your inspiration(s)?\n**Code:**\n> When it comes to the NFT marketplace what inspires me is creating something valuable enough that someone is willing to pay big dollars for. Trying to create value and virality is an interesting topic for sure. Many factors go into selling NFT’s. It’s not just about how nice the art is. It’s about breaking it down into its specific niche, and targeting a niche in that niche while creating the value and the community simultaneously. If your art is beautiful, but it’s too general, it won’t sell. Dialing down into who would really want this is an important aspect of finding inspiration. In summary, I guess my inspiration comes from creating desirable and thought-provoking art for other humans.\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**Code:**\n> I plan to branch out my skills into the 3D realm. I realize that 3D assets serve more functionality when it comes to synthesizing the metaverse through virtual and augmented reality. 3D adds another layer that 2D can not accomplish. I see so many projects going backward by pixelating themselves, but I think the right move is moving forward in 3D. \n> So I am currently learning Blender for 3D animation.\n\n\n### Q: How do you see the NFT space shaping up?\n**Code:**\n> It’s still a very new wild west sorta environment. This is partly why there is so much hype money in it. The space will evolve. I think we will get to a point where every song and movie is an NFT. There is real functionality and purpose for them in the future, but at this current moment, it’s all pixelated copycats.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6KZ8fb2.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What would you most like an NFT platform to have?\n**Code:**\n> 3 important things: \n> 1. **Auctions**: How else is the market to decide a ‘market price’? I recommend candle auctions similar to parachian auctions to prevent bad actors and promote fairness and transparency.\n> 2. **Royalties**: This is the purpose of blockchain and motivation for great art and artists.\n> 3. **Low fees**: OpenSea has a lot of good functionality but it’s still built on Ethereum and those fees break the app in my opinion. It’s unusable for the non-whales.\n> \n> The fact that Singular is built on Kusama is the main reason that brought me to the platform. Kusama has a big future. Especially with the merging of all ERC20 via Moonriver and Moonbeam.\n\n\n### Q: Imagine a use case for RMRK 2.0 powered NFTs. / Have you considered making use of RMRK 2.0 functionality in your future works? To get context, you can check out this post.\n**Code:**\n> Yes. Gamified 3D NFTs sound fun. I’ll be around. :)\n\n\n\n---\n\nOne thing that's really fascinating to us is that Code has found a way to sell his collections via auctions even though [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/) hasn't added that feature yet (it's in the works, a little more patience 🙏🏾). This further proves his creative ingenuity and we are super excited to get full RMRK 2.0 functionality into the hands of a forward-thinking artist like Code. Imagine what he would be able to create with Nested NFTs, Multi-resource NFTs, etc. \n\nWe had a great time chatting with Code and look forward to the rest of the [Ku Collection](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/EtF8MpQPXrqAtrwvuE6Ni4BvBMNPMXyxTug6WkzuV5utB1e?page=1&tab=created&creator=true).

        "body": "NFTs are a big topic right now, but do they actually bear value?\n\n\nNon Fungible Tokens have been around for quite some time and have been on the rise on ETH based platforms since 2017.\n\nSome NFT projects that launched in the beginning gained enormous value over time. The original crypto punks for example trade for millions of $.\n\nThis is mind boggling and always was very secretive to me as I never understood why somebody would pay those amounts of actual money to own a pixelated picture.\n\nI had no grip on the whole topic and put it in the back of my mind in the folder: “Don’t understand it, just a hype, nonsense.“\n\n\n\nI am a big believer and supporter of the Dotsama (Polkadot and Kusama) ecosystem,\nA few weeks ago while browsing Dotsama and talking to fellow explorers I grouped up with along the way, I stumbled across Singular.\n\nSingular is a Kusama based NFT platform.\n\nSo here I was being confronted with the topic of NFTs again. The knowledge I had was that NFTs are expensive to mint due to gas prices and that most of those NFTs just bear value because they are a hyped up topic.\n\nBeing narrow minded does not lead you anywhere in crypto so I decided to scrap what I knew about NFTs and give it a second chance.\nHere is my opinion and what I have learned after being in touch with NFTs and Singular / RMRK for about two months:\n\nIt is addictive ! ! !\n\nI can relate to the 2017 craze very much as similar things are happening right now on the KSM based app.\n\nA relatively small group of first movers, OGs and explorers are playing around with the app. Very different art-projects are launched on Singular and every project in itself has a different direction of where they want to take their art. It is a very gamified version of the traditional way of creating or dealing with “art“.\n\nBut isn’t it expensive to take part in this as minting an NFT is costly and you wouldn’t spend hundreds of $ to upload a JPEG to the app…\n\nThis is the key point where it all changed for me.\n\nMinting an NFT (creating the NFT) on Singular costs as much as roughly 0.04$ worth of KSM.\n\nThis is a very low entry barrier and allows anyone to dip a toe into the topic and get a feel for themselves.\nSimply visit https://singular.rmrk.app/ and connect your polkadot.js wallet and you are all good to buy, mint or send NFTs.\n\n\nOk, so its cool, you can create stuff and it’s cheap to use on Singular… anyone can do it, so where is the value in anything minted as an NFT?\n\nWhy would I spend 0.01KSM or 1 KSM or 10 KSM for something, just to have it under the “owned“ section? Where is the value behind some pixels?\n\nWhich factors do I think are important for any .JPEG or .MP4 to bear value?\n\nWell there are two sides to it in my opinion.\n\nFirst you have the obvious art factor.\n\nA already well known and respected artist publishes a line of NFTs.\nWhen, for example, Banksy would create a line of NFTs with a maximum of 20 artworks, would you ape in and try to get one? Most probably yes, depending on the price — right?\n\nAs of now there are very few known artists on Singular.\nThere is cool art such as for example Kusam-ART https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/66f193bc935bfcda57-G5GVH\n\nBut no big names have released anything there as far as I know.\n\n\nThe other and more impressive side of NFTs is symbolic creations or creations with a value imbedded in the idea behind creating the line of NFTs.\n\nAs mentioned, Singular is running on Kusama. Thereby the Kusama bird as NFT can be a symbol of believing in Kusama and its success. As early mover you might want to own one of the Infinity Canary birds: https://singular.rmrk.app/collections/54bc17ab38241f8463-INFINIKU\n\nOr at least check out the KU_collection which are already trading at respectable prices: https://singular.rmrk.app/space/EtF8MpQPXrqAtrwvuE6Ni4BvBMNPMXyxTug6WkzuV5utB1e?page=1&tab=created&creator=true\n\nOwning an original canary from one of those two collections is symbolic and fun. As the community grows, many people would want to get such a symbolic badge too, which then increases the value of the badge itself.\n\n\nAnd now there is the topic of why I decided to dive deeper into the whole topic and create a line of NFTs of my own.\n\nIt’s the ideology of creating a community with certain values.\nIn the recent dull of the crypto market my hungriness stayed high and the activity on Twitter didn’t slow down for me.\n\nI was doing research, I communicated with like-minded people and slowly got closer with a group of fellow apes who had likeminded ideologies as me. Doing research, gathering knowledge and sharing this knowledge within this circle.\nJust like the Canaries can be seen as a badge, the idea arose to create a more serious community within the Dotsama Twitter community.\n\nThere is a certain group of very knowledgeable people within the Dotsama ecosystem called the ChaosDAO. We are early movers and we care about fundamentals rather than hype. Its a tribe of people from all levels of knowledge and this is the exact reason why it is functioning so well. Narratives are being questioned, ideas are being ping-ponged and in the end everybody is a bit smarter.\nThe idea of growing this great community lead me to creating the ChaosDAO apes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ApesAndArt\n\nNot just a .JPEG NFT, not a badge of believe but more like a membership of to bigger idea and ideology. In short: A collective of core Dotsama believers and developers.\n\nHolding a ChaosDAO APE would not only show your deep conviction in Dotsama like a badge would, it would also grant you access to this well elaborated community.\n\nIts sort of a fast pass to come to the right place to strengthen your believes and exchange knowledge without having to go through 5 different telegram groups to find a place you feel comfortable in. Or Twitter for example. Maybe you would never follow an account with only 30 followers, but what if this individual is a genius and could bring you ideas that you would never have gotten anywhere else?\nThe vision behind the ChaosDAO APEs is to enable any holder access to knowledge and truly likeminded people. This bears value and makes a ChaosDAO APE not only nice to look at, but gives reason beyond aping around and having fun playing degen on twitter. We are constantly moving forward and there are new things to discover pretty much daily that barely make it onto twitter or any telegram groups.\n\nThis being said and having absolutely shilled the ChaosDAO (https://twitter.com/ChaosDAO) and the APEs, I come to this conclusion:\n\nNFTs do bear value and are worth a certain amount.\n\nWhen trying to figure out the value of a fresh NFT project, you want to look at it like looking at a startup from an investors POV.\n\n-Do I like the product?\n-What is the vision?\n-Is the founder able to pull it off? And will he do this over a long period?\n-What value would it hold in the future?\n\nIf you made it this far in this write up, I would suggest you go visit Singular and look around. There is cool art in the „curated“ section.\nObviously we will be more than happy to welcome you at https://twitter.com/ApesAndArt to stay updated about the DAO Apes and be updated about the next drop.",

A fix is in progress in [this PR](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/559).\n\nAfter this fix is applied, **it will take up to a week for it to land in Statemine** - it depends on how fast the Kusama Council adds it to the upgrade queue, votes it in, and the community confirms the vote.\n\nBut... We're almost there! 🎉\n\nYou can keep an eye on whether or not this has already happened by:\n\n- subscribing to [Dot Leap](https://newsletter.dotleap.com) (weekly updates, around Monday / Tuesday)\n- monitoring the [Democracy page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/democracy)\n- monitoring the [Parachains page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains), the Statemine entry will have a value of \"Upgrading in XX (time)\"\n- keeping an eye on [Polkassembly on-chain threads](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/onchain)\n- [following us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rmrkapp) and turning on the \"notification bell\" to get push notifications when we tweet\n- [joining our Announcement Channel](https://t.me/rmrk_ann)\n\n## Claim Process\n\nRather than make you wait for a custom claims UI like originally intended, we have decided to automatically distribute the tokens to your Statemine addresses instead. No action will be necessary from your end. \n\n> **👇 PLEASE READ 👇**\n> \n> 🚨 The tokens will go to the **SAME** address which holds the eggs, but **ON THE STATEMINE CHAIN** where the token is generated. Substrate chains (like Kusama, Polkadot, Statemine etc.) can reuse the same wallet! 🚨\n> \n> **☝ PLEASE READ ☝**\n\nHere's what will happen:\n\n1. We will seed your account with ~0.0001 KSM. **We will send you this KSM, no action is needed on your part**. This is necessary because accounts with no KSM do not exist in \"chain terms\" and cannot recieve tokens. The account address will be the SAME as the one you used for interactions with Kanaria, the chains share the addresses. You can use one wallet / address to interact with both Kusama an Statemine.\n2. We will send you the allocated amount of tokens very soon after minting. We'll do some testing with our own balances first and check that everything is fine, then send out to all others.\n3. Your balance will become visible on [Singular.rmrk.app](https://singular.rmrk.app) and [Kanaria.rmrk.app](https://kanaria.rmrk.app) in the header, and on [Kanaria's tokens page](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/tokens).\n4. You can send your tokens out of your address by going to the [Asset Balances page on Statemine](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-statemine-rpc.paritytech.net#/assets/balances) and picking the asset in the number 8, RMRK. This will list all accounts of yours that have the tokens, and from there you'll be able to send them. Remember point 1 - only accounts on Statemine with more than 0.000003 KSM in them can recieve RMRK tokens.\n\n### What about claiming to different addresses?\n\nOriginally we wanted to make a claim UI which would let you input a custom address to get the tokens to an address different to the one you have eggs on. This would have slowed down other development, so we chose not to pursue this option.\n\nHowever, if you would really like to do this, please [fill out this form](https://url.rmrk.app/altclaim) **before August 15th** and keep in mind that it might take up to 1 week extra to deliver your tokens, plus any time we might have to spend correcting your inputs (it requires cryptographically signing a message).\n\nThe whole process is also documented as a step by step video here: https://youtu.be/IhAzVLJms0A\n\n### I lost access to my wallet, what now?\n\nAs stated in the [faq a while back](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-token-utility-and-other-fa-qs-18366), since there is no way to prove you owned an address without owning that address, your tokens and your birds are lost. There is no way for us to recover them for you.\n\n### Will I see my balance in the Polkadot Extension?\n\nThe extension is just a key store, it stores your account keys encrypted with a password. It is not, and never will be a Metamask alternative, and will **never** show any balances for any chain, because it **never** connects to any chain. Connections happen in user interfaces people build FOR a specific chain, and those interfaces then ask the extension for access to the address and key.\n\nSo: no, you will NOT see your tokens or your KSM in the extension, ever. See points 3 and 4 above for how to read your token balance and send the tokens to other addresses, including exchange addresses.\n\n### Can I import my account into a mobile wallet to see my tokens?\n\nNo, currently there are no mobile wallets that support custom tokens. It is next on [Fearless](https://fearlesswallet.io/)' roadmap, so should not be far off, but at this point in time, RMRK tokens will not be usable or visible in Fearless.\n\n### What should Kucoin users do?\n\nNothing, just wait. Because all your eggs are in your Kucoin account, and Kucoin stores them all in one address, all tokens will go to their address. It is then up to them to distribute the tokens to you. This shouldn't take more than a few days, but for specific timelines and requirements you'll have to talk to them.",

We first noticed Thomas through his numerous high-quality submissions to the [Kanaria art contest](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/preliminary-art-contest-winners-18944). His birds were incredibly imaginative, three of which were part of the final 40 designs that were chosen.

I didn't have any courses, degrees, and skills at that moment. Well, except drawing penises in books while I was in school...lol. \n> \n> But then life put me in a position where I had to learn something to pay the bills. Me and my girlfriend, whom I met a year before, had decided to live together. She was facing some issues with her parents and I decided to help her.\n> \n> It was our first year in university and for obvious reasons, we didn’t have any skills to find decent work, so I had to learn something (graphic design) fast and work my ass off 24/7 in an attempt to reach some level and clients. Very interesting way to start your career, but at least now it pays off.\n> \n> Very soon I found my first job as a graphic designer for 200$ per month. Now we could afford to eat something. As soon as I got the job, I started to dedicate all my free time to client work as a freelancer.\n> \n> We managed to save some money from that and I bought my first illustration course and since that moment my whole career has belonged to illustration, character design and so on.\n![Kanaria bird by Thomas Jerrykson](https://i.imgur.com/IKhFIuH.jpg)\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Thomas Jerrykson:**\n> I missed NFT's boom last year because I thought at the time that you had to have some big media base to promote your art, which I obviously didn't have. So my thoughts were like: \"okay, I'm just gonna do my stuff for now, and if this trend doesn’t die, I'll try to get into NFTs later\". \n> But my mate Valentine, whose arts you could also see in Kanaria's art contest, told me about it and I thought it was a good opportunity for me to get familiar with how NFTs work and try to take some steps into it.\n\n### Q: What is your favorite kind of art to work on?\n**Thomas Jerrykson:**\n> I got lucky to work with a couple of big brands in Russia, for example, Sberbank, one of the biggest banks in the country. All such projects are my favorites. Not only because they pay well, but also because they allow you to do what you think is necessary, don't ask you to make a ton of revisions, and just let you create some cool stuff for them. \n> \n> And that's such a good side of NFT which I've been looking for, you can do what you love with your head and hands, without corrections from clients, their managers, or imaginary friends.\n\n\n### Q: NFTs have provided accessibility and exposure to various forms of digital creations. Do you have new artists that you follow and what do you find interesting about them?\n**Thomas Jerrykson:**\n> Speaking of NFT artists, unfortunately, I didn't find anyone to follow or get inspired by yet. I have a strong base of awesome illustrators and concept artists who I follow on Instagram and Artstation. Maybe some of them make NFT's, but I started following them long before all of that. \n> \n> It seems to me, the great majority of NFT artists work with the \"quantity vs quality\" rule, and this is a problem for creators who want to share their art in this niche. \n> \n![](https://i.imgur.com/zVlLt7G.jpg)\n>\n> Let's use our imagination for a little bit - a young lady, who forgot how her friends and parents look because she dedicated all her time to drawing 2D cats, taking online classes, and praying to all gods to get better at drawing those cats. When done, she opens various NFT platforms to get into this new business all her colleagues have been talking about. And what does she see? Tons of pretty much the same art all around the marketplaces. \n> \n> I guess this can scare everyone. No one wants to be lost in this mess and not even be able to get noticed. Because while she is spending a week on drawing her art, the \"all types of low-poly vaginas collection\" will have 100 more pieces in the meantime.\n> \n> So, according to this, the NFT world seems to me like not the best place to find someone to get inspired by. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are so many good artists, but the situation I just talked about makes me search for inspiration in other places :D\n\n### Q: What is your creative process like?\n**Thomas Jerrykson:**\n> My creation process always starts with references. Once I've read the brief and so on, I go to all my folders with movie screenshots, cartoons, concept arts, or anything else that can give me ideas or solutions to specific tasks. After that, I do sketches in Photoshop, then line art in Illustrator, and drop it back to Photoshop for coloring. \n> \n> For those who may be interested why the hell I do these 300iq machinations for line-work, I got a simple answer - I have 2 left hands, and the only way for me to create smooth lines is to make them by pen-tool in Illustrator. It's pretty much a waste of time, but I like when the line-work is nice and clean.\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SZuXrXY.jpg)\n\n**Thomas Jerrykson:**\n> As I said before, I love the opportunities which NFT provides to artists, and my goal is to create some interesting series which people would love to own so I could buy myself an island in the Maldives. But, I don't wanna follow that trend of 1000s items in one series, so you can expect very limited collections from me. One of them I'm gonna release in September, it will include something like 15 NFTs inspired by cult movies which I personally love to re-watch sometimes. \n\n### Q: What would you most like an NFT platform to have?\n**Thomas Jerrykson:**\n> Some kind of promotion or something like that for artists who just joined the platform would be cool I guess. More filters for searching with keywords or tags or whatever else. Maybe some weekly top lists, moderated by some person or community. In other words, something to make good collections stand out and represent their value.\n\n### Q: How do you see the NFT space shaping up?\n**Thomas Jerrykson:**\n> I think NFT will be shaping up along with all other crypto integration in people's lives. So many people are still very confused and skeptical about everything related to crypto. As confident as they will feel about crypto as popular as NFTs will be for creators.\n\n\n### Q: What exciting new stuff can we look forward to from you?\n**Thomas Jerrykson:**\n> For those who have seen my art and liked it, I would recommend staying tuned for autumn. I'm going to stop taking commissions soon and dedicate all my time to the Cult movies series I'm preparing for minting. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m9SFdmL.jpg)\n\n> You can find the progression of it and more of my art on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thomas_jerrykson/), my [portfolio](https://www.behance.net/1_Thomas_Jerrykson), or contact me for any questions on telegram: **@illustratorthomasj**\n\n---\n\nWe enjoyed our conversation with Thomas and can relate to his views on the quantity vs quality issue in crypto art. It's always refreshing to speak to an artist who is willing to say exactly what he thinks. We look forward to his Cult Movies Series--*Pulp Fiction* and *Forest Gump* have been confirmed thus far.\n\n\n*Know any interesting crypto artists doing something cool, wild, or groundbreaking?

        "body": "On this week's episode of RAS, we chatted with **Ruben Topia**, an extremely talented digital artist and illustrator from the Netherlands. His artworks are so loaded with detail you can't help getting sucked into them. \n\nIn our talk with him, we saw that underneath the simple complexity in his works is a refined mind that's not afraid to dream big--not just in the material accomplishment sense of the word, but also in its relation with higher human values. \n\nFeast your eyes on his work below before reading the rest of the interview.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ss3CWv9.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Q: How did you start your art career?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> Hello, I am Ruben Topia. My family name is Brown. I believe that family is our roots (brown), our grounding on earth. \n> \n> Since I was a kid, I was a dreamer. Art is a broad concept, and personally, I have my main interest in imaginative works, art that is inspired and empowered by visions of the higher and lower realms. Works that depict the things we might not see every day but that we feel in our hearts. I always liked magical, psychedelic videos and paintings. M.C.Escher was my favorite artist and I was born in the city of Jheronimus Bosch. \n> \n> I didn’t like high school. I went to study interactive graphic design and illustration at the art academy in Rotterdam. I graduated in 2018. Now I am free.\n\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> \n> It wasn't until February 2021 that I heard about NFTs. Maybe late seeing as platforms like OpenSea and Rarible had already been online for years. \n> \n> At first, it was hard to get my head around it, but then I finally recognized it as a great tool for empowering digital artists. Once I understood it in this manner, I started sharing my work, trying to sell them for as much ETH as possible. But I also wanted to do them well and make them as interesting as possible in the form of videos--collectibles that are numbered and intended to be a series just like in my book where all the +200 illustrations are isometric and so match with one another. \n\n\n### Q: Tell us about your favorite project (client or personal) that you've worked on and why.\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> My favorite project I have worked on is this ongoing series of personal illustrations. By the end of 2019, I combined all illustrations into my first book called ‘Inner Kingdom’. Recent illustrations till this moment of writing will be published into the next magic book. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TrBd7r6.jpg)\n\n\n> \n> These are created from an inner drive that is fueled by the idea of creating my own world. When you work for clients it can be because you like it or because it pays. Money should not be the focus. The paintings that I make because I want to are my favorite since I am driven to do it by the inner voice that wants to speak out and become visible. \n> \n> I also like to work with festivals and play for the art director.\n\n\n### Q: NFTs have provided accessibility and exposure to various forms of digital creations. Do you have new artists that you follow and what do you find interesting about them?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> It’s nice to look around the NFT platforms and find interesting projects. But I am old-fashioned and so I follow the same artists that I did before on Instagram, in books, and in real life. The NFT context creates a new frame for art that is easy to consume, comparable to TikTok where the creator has to get the attention of the viewer in the first second. Because of this, the value of each work becomes similar and you tend to scroll through your feed. We should see each work of art as an act of wonder. But since there are so many, it’s easy to drown in the ocean of the internet.\n\n### Q: What is your creative process like?\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qTQOk5e.jpg)\n\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> I live in a village. Then I walk around barefoot on the grass outside. I look around and see a bird. I don’t really know what all these animals outside are doing all the time. Maybe they have secret lives and secret underground nightclubs. Then I go inside and draw my ideas on paper. It’s mostly temples and buildings or things that I see in society that I find strange. Sometimes I paint. The best thing would be to get into a flow state and animate.\n> \n> Then I go to the city to scan my work or I make photographs of them. The village is for playing, the city is for work. The village is open and the city is full. \n\n\n### Q: Who and what are your inspirations?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> All the artists who are heavily inspired by nature and transcendental experiences like M.C.Escher, Gaudi, Alex Grey, Waone Interesni Kazki, and much more.\n> \n> The unknown artists (to me) from the middle east who paint temples and mystical deserts full of oases hundreds of years ago and thangka art from the east which is not about the painting but about the process of creating.\n> \n> Also, symbolism like in the tarot cards, talks by Osho, walks by the river, and of course, meditation, which I find inspiring but don’t do too often.\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> I want to create a digital country (let's call it: Rutopia) consisting of a series of isometric worlds different in size and shape but having the same perspective and handwriting. I already have such a series of isometric worlds and it would be a good idea to number them and put them online as a digital country where people can own parts of it. The goal of this would be to say that borders don’t need to be physical. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1no5FNb.jpg)\n> \n> This imaginary country is an idea inspired by the book *Codex Seraphianus* created by Luigi Serafini, which is an encyclopedia of an imaginary world with textures, people, cities, nature, animals, and language. \n\n### Q: How do you see the NFT space shaping up?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> It is shaping up with a lot of hype and confusion. Beauty is personal, but the quality of work that is being released is very different. Without curation, a platform quickly becomes another DeviantArt. Platforms like Superrare are good because they only allow well-known artists. \n\n\n### Q: What would you most like an NFT platform to have?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> A virtual gallery to show and promote artworks for viewing online or with VR glasses; a curator who categorized everything in its value; and a use case that is linked to the real world. \n\n### Q: Have you considered making use of RMRK 2.0 functionality in your future works?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> Yes. I would be able to create an empty land of Rutopia. Then people can buy NFT temples and characters to put on the land. I haven’t started this yet, but I have part of the drawings ready to cut out and play with.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J3cInwb.jpg)\n\n### Q: What exciting new stuff can we look forward to from you?\n**Ruben Topia:**\n> I have a new large detailed art coming up. I am also working on multiple animations for my new book coming next year. \n\n---\nWe absolutely adore Ruben's work and would happily spend hours admiring his detailed pieces on his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rubentopia/). We highly recommend that you take a look, you'll be amazed. You can also catch up with Ruben on his [website](https://www.rubentopia.com/), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@Ruben_Topia), and [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/GvqD3GHvmcVpUQssW9dZrKmH5gabUXvNeeh9aUcHkC66Q7v).\n\n---\n\n\n***Are you a talented digital artist?

Kanaria will be our testing ground for RMRK 2.0 functionality, and as it matures we'll bring it over into Singular.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9pEbKRr.png)\n\nThese are RMRK 2.0 NFTs, supporting multiple resources.\n\nThe search filters should help you sift through the items, and you'll notice none of them appear in several copies - this is because right now we're grouping identical items. If you look at an individual item's details, you will see \"Edition of: X\" where X is how many copies of it exist.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Mgp561w.png)\n\nSome of these items will be distributed to the birds we're going to be minting soon. Others will be put on the open market soon afterwards (after all bird owners have had a chance to sell theirs if they wish). But this is the full genesis set of items we've prepared. We'll be minting more items later and expanding the universe, but these are the OG, the ones you're getting as eggdopters, and the ones that have the highest value potential in Kanaria universe projects.\n\nNow, beware - there be dragons (and bugs). But we're moving ahead with deployments piece by piece.\n\nThe two biggest hold-ups were the implementation of themes, and the implementation of mutable attributes.\n\n### Themes\n\nThemes allow an item to have a single resource, and then be themed, rather than it being a wasteful 5 resources. For example: an axe that is white can be a purple axe if themed purple. Building on that, we had to finish theme inheritance. \n\nFor example, if you have a Jedi who is evil with a red theme, and a Jedi who is good with a green theme, then holding a neutral lightsaber (white by default) will switch that lightsaber's color to red or green, depending on who's holding it.\n\n### Mutable Attributes\n\nWe promised you that birds would have mutable names so you can call them something like Mr. Featherfluff instead of Founder Bird 95. For this, we needed to define a lot of tricky things like:\n\n- how to define who can change an attribute\n\n- how to define conditions under which it can change\n\n- how to define how many times it can change\n\n- how to do all this and prevent rug-pulls by collection issuer, while also preventing abuse by NFT owner(s)\n\n- how to do all this while allowing for a secondary item economy, so people can obtain name-change crystals later on too\n\n- how to abstract this enough to apply to different \"use item to change something\" scenarios that may extend beyond Kanaria.\n    \n![https://media.giphy.com/media/l41JS59bOt1Bl7VAI/source.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/l41JS59bOt1Bl7VAI/source.gif)\n\nWe can develop something Kanaria specific, but keep in mind that the more edge cases we cover for Kanaria only, the less standardized the birds are and thus less portable between different RMRK standard implementers.\n\nThis part is still under active development, but we are approaching a compromise that lets us ship a bit of a nerfed version now, but doesn't break mutable attributes for RMRK 2.0 post-launch as we iron it out further.\n\nFor a full story on other complexities and to learn how it all really works, please see [this crowdcast](https://url.rmrk.app/rmrkcc). It's 1 hour well worth your time.\n\nStay tuned for birds soon!",

        "body": "First, apologies for skipping the artist spotlight last week. But we're back baby!\n\nOn this week's episode of RAS (RMRK Artist Spotlight) we interview **Erphan Malek**, one of the most talented artists we've met. Doubt us? Check out some of his works below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iwTVdMF.jpg)\n\n\nErphan is a 32-year-old Iranian digital artist and illustrator who started his career as an enviroment and chararter designer for animated series. He is a big time game lover who's had a dream of creating his own game since he was a kid. The vibrancy and dynamism one senses from his work seems to bear the outward fruits of this desire.\n\nWe chatted about his foray into crypto and NFTs, his favorite work, his art creation process, and more. Read the interview below.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> I first saw the *OpenSea* website by chance but didn’t know how to sell my work there. Later on, a good friend sent me a Foundation invite and taught me how to mint my works there.\n\n### Q: What is your favorite art creation (personal or client)?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> [My Monuments](https://foundation.app/@erphanmalek) collection is one of my favorite personal projects. The combination of architecture with different faces tells a story that involves the audience emotionally. This is why the collection is special to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Piuwshl.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What has being in the NFT space shown you that you would not have seen if you were still outside? \n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Before getting acquainted with NFTs, I never knew we had lots of good artists, particularly in my country. I found so many new artists and made friends with them. The fascinating this is that each of them has their own worldview and the way they present their work. Seeing these varieties of artwork is really attractive to me.\n\n\n\n### Q: What is your creation process like?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Normally, it starts with an idea and then I start making some simple schemes on paper. I usually set it down in two or three different schemes before choosing the one with the best formation and shape. Then I add more details using software and, if needed, make some necessary changes. When I'm satisfied with what I have, then I start the final performance.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K71jG15.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q: What are your inspirations?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> I get ideas from almost everything. I can be inspired by nature, animals, my experiences, people I meet, or books I read. I am also inspired by art in the form of animation and movies I watch.\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Although I have created many works in the past, I've never made any decent income with them. But with NFTs and the many available platforms now my artworks have the chance to be seen and collected by so many people. Thankfully, I work in different styles and my plan is to dedicate the various styles to different platforms. My works are currently on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/erphanmalek), [Hic Et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1MLJf8TkAZ7gY5jCmNoCauVYZ2cWBsFdfe/creations), and [Art Station](https://www.artstation.com/erphanmalek).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XC7qISw.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q: What’s your favorite platform and why? It doesn’t have to be RMRK. We promise, won’t hold it against you.\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> My favorite Nft platform is Hic Et Nunc because of its culture. \nOften, artists collect artworks and support each other. I have not seen many collectors there.\n\n\n### Q: What are your honest thoughts on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/)?\n\n> I think it's very user-friendly and has an excellent UI. I have not used many platforms yet but I think Singular is one of the best.\n\n\n*Check out Erphan's Princess Mononoke NFT on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/collectibles/8241121-a083f5bc1cc13d4e2a-GCNNY-PRINCESSMONONOKE-0000000000000001).*\n\n---\n\nOur biggest takeway from this interview is how detailed Erphan's creation process is. It perfectly explains why his art is so striking.

        "body": "Hey **NFT enthusiasts**. \n\nOn this episode of RAS, we had a quick chat with talented illustrator and art director **Justine Cruz**, a crypto artist that resides in the Philippines. \n\nThe first thing one notices about Justine's work is the exciting characters at the center of it all. This isn't to suggest that the pencil work and paintwork are subpar. On the contrary, his sketching and paintwork are some of the best in the cryptoart space. \n\nCheck out some of his works and the interview below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UfxtJhy.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Q: How did you start your art career?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> I studied to become a nurse, but by the time I graduated, I couldn’t find any Nursing jobs here in the Philippines because of the oversaturation of nurses at the time. So I decided to do what I loved the most: drawing and painting.\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> Months ago, I noticed the NFT trend and saw it as a chance to finally sell my digital artworks.\n\n### Q: What is your favorite kind of art to work on?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> Card game-related illustrations are my favorite. They let me enjoy what I love the most--painting.\n\n\n### Q: Tell us about your Alien Pets project and how it came to be\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6yVMz51.jpg)\n\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> I was inspired by some of the creature artists that I follow and hoped to make something from my own imagination. That, plus I also have a dog and wanted to create an alien version of him. :) Excited to share more!\n\n### Q: NFTs have provided accessibility and exposure to various forms of digital creations. Do you have new artists that you follow and what do you find interesting about them?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> I love the works of [Peter Mohrbacher](https://twitter.com/bugmeyer?s=20), [Jason Chan](https://twitter.com/JasonChanArt), and [James Jean](https://twitter.com/JamesJeanArt). I just love their unique styles. They inspire me to improve on what I do.\n\n\n### Q: What is your creative process like?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> Nothing special really. It starts with collecting inspiration and references, sketching, and then painting until it's finished.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AGLk9wl.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What are your inspirations?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> Nothing specific. I am mostly inspired by the works of different artists.\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> I want to be part of the growth of NFTs, I believe that this is the future of art.\n\n\n### Q: How do you see the NFT space shaping up?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> Slowly but surely.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AVk8suH.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What exciting new stuff can we look forward to from you?\n**Justine Cruz:**\n> I will continue this Alien series and will start another one the Mask series. :)\n\n---\n\nWhat do you think of Justine's art? Great stuff, right? His [Artstation page](https://www.artstation.com/justinecruz) is an artist's dream. Looking through the different characters, it's hard to stop myself from dreaming up backstories for them. \n\nWe had a good time chatting with Justine and are looking forward to future installments to his Alien Pet series. You can catch up with him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinecruzart).\n\n\n*Know any interesting crypto artists doing something cool, wild, or groundbreaking?

        "body": "First, apologies for skipping the artist spotlight last week. But we're back baby!\n\nOn this week's episode of RAS (RMRK Artist Spotlight) we interview **Erphan Malek**, one of the most talented artists we've met. Doubt us? Check out some of his works below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iwTVdMF.jpg)\n\n\nErphan is a 32-year-old Iranian digital artist and illustrator who started his career as an enviroment and chararter designer for animated series. He is a big time game lover who's had a dream of creating his own game since he was a kid. The vibrancy and dynamism one senses from his work seems to bear the outward fruits of this desire.\n\nWe chatted about his foray into crypto and NFTs, his favorite work, his art creation process, and more. Read the interview below.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> I first saw the *OpenSea* website by chance but didn’t know how to sell my work there. Later on, a good friend sent me a Foundation invite and taught me how to mint my works there.\n\n### Q: What is your favorite art creation (personal or client)?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> [My Monuments](https://foundation.app/@erphanmalek) collection is one of my favorite personal projects. The combination of architecture with different faces tells a story that involves the audience emotionally. This is why the collection is special to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Piuwshl.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What has being in the NFT space shown you that you would not have seen if you were still outside? \n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Before getting acquainted with NFTs, I never knew we had lots of good artists, particularly in my country. I found so many new artists and made friends with them. The fascinating this is that each of them has their own worldview and the way they present their work. Seeing these varieties of artwork is really attractive to me.\n\n\n\n### Q: What is your creation process like?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Normally, it starts with an idea and then I start making some simple schemes on paper. I usually set it down in two or three different schemes before choosing the one with the best formation and shape. Then I add more details using software and, if needed, make some necessary changes. When I'm satisfied with what I have, then I start the final performance.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K71jG15.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q: What are your inspirations?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> I get ideas from almost everything. I can be inspired by nature, animals, my experiences, people I meet, or books I read. I am also inspired by art in the form of animation and movies I watch.\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Although I have created many works in the past, I've never made any decent income with them. But with NFTs and the many available platforms now my artworks have the chance to be seen and collected by so many people. Thankfully, I work in different styles and my plan is to dedicate the various styles to different platforms. My works are currently on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/erphanmalek), [Hic Et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1MLJf8TkAZ7gY5jCmNoCauVYZ2cWBsFdfe/creations), and [Art Station](https://www.artstation.com/erphanmalek).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XC7qISw.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q: What’s your favorite platform and why? It doesn’t have to be RMRK. We promise, won’t hold it against you.\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> My favorite Nft platform is Hic Et Nunc because of its culture. \nOften, artists collect artworks and support each other. I have not seen many collectors there.\n\n\n### Q: What are your honest thoughts on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/)?\n\n> I think it's very user-friendly and has an excellent UI. I have not used many platforms yet but I think Singular is one of the best.\n\n\n*Check out Erphan's Princess Mononoke NFT on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/collectibles/8241121-a083f5bc1cc13d4e2a-GCNNY-PRINCESSMONONOKE-0000000000000001).*\n\n---\n\nOur biggest takeway from this interview is how detailed Erphan's creation process is. It perfectly explains why his art is so striking. Thank heavens for Bitcoin, which gave us Ethereum, that granted us NFTs, which exposed us to Erphan's artistic brilliance.\n\nWe had a good time chatting with Erphan and we hope you enjoyed reading it too. Until next week.

We’ve had a good time going over all the entries, and with the final announcement of winners less than 3 days away, we wrote this post to inform you of important developments and what to expect.\n\nFirst, we would like to congratulate the preliminary winners 🥳. You’re probably thinking *“what the heck are preliminary winners?”* Well, to explain, we need to talk about plagiarism. \n\n## Plagiarism and the Disqualified Lovelies (preliminary losers)\nIn deciding the winners of the art contest, we ran into a knot of a problem—plagiarism. Because the crypto space, and by extension NFTs, are unregulated, there is rampant abuse of Intellectual Property rights. \n\nAs a believer in the values of intellectual property ownership and the fair rights they confer on the artist, we had to disqualify from the contest plagiarists (who intentionally flouted plagiarism rules) and some worthy contenders (who accidentally ignored copyright, or thought it was fine to ignore). \n\nWhile we like the work of the worthy contenders, we are legally prevented from choosing them because we’re paying for this as an Association, and so we cannot legally buy copyright protected assets not labeled for reuse of commercial activity.\n\nYou can [read this post for more information](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/dealing-with-plagiarism-18790) on our reasoning. \n\nThus, **the preliminary winners consists of all the artworks that were not disqualified because of plagiarism**.\n\n## The Results\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s see what’s left and select the preliminary winners.\n\n\n### [Egg

Well, we decided to give away the 10 additional winners NFTs above in a limited collection to 10 random addresses of voters! It's our way of saying thank you and spreading the rewards to more people. \n\n|| Randomly Selected Winners |\n|-------|-------|\n|1|CsD72ZMpaoYsBVkSWNUBhAyZRsxYkjff7moXJssoKK4wooP|\n|2|E8TZHK4uTudw7UdB3p2cZq2u7S9ugPd322RYBCkjyZqNV8N|\n|3|GS3F6w6FXLeyqzfWRyQ5LGtq3bW5DfXANegutaZSiHXjvK8|\n|4|EkntPBZ9cayLZZWW54B16RnKBMbM5RCFVuDWncfBX7RaeYN|\n|5|FyYb6dUsGMuXXHtMcaCYRw7eL4pSYkTvAPDkzprPY4Apuom|\n|6|D6TEqRXXV2gjGAhiMhEGJVQJNoSPeVifJ9mqQm7ApEeFndV|\n|7|GXW8PiLizGNwUNTcWomWm9K435qJ7Hdq6DwGUmUdcCDJx3S|\n|8|EUU4cb2uLxZv6idyK3561AYv55ovoG6jCfHiv4CjapU9tie|\n|9|Gw2P9r18p9NTru1EPo6kompYHhdV1vANBQqPjVK5tyguYNs|\n|10|ESvc7sfsCvaqh2f8EfrFarYQ11JH5mo2VFGYdwzoBcxiGs3|\n\n\n## The Raffle Winner\n\nThis is probably the one you guys are most excited for. The [big raffle winner](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/art-contest-reward-boost-18769). To ensure complete randomness, we used random.org to execute the raffle draw. \n\n|| Randomly Selected Winner |\n|-------|-------|\n|1|FegWWJq7AWgkYguRAd796uvNVYburnURpBz7wZ9kf5EoyZ5|\n\n## Claiming Prizes\n\nArt Contest winners may claim their prizes in **Fiat** or **KSM**. All other winners may claim their prizes in KSM.\n\n* **USD (Fiat)** - Payment will take **up to 2 weeks** from the time the form is completed and can be done via Bank Transfer or Paypal. If you want to recieve in fiat, then fill [this form](https://form.typeform.com/to/wjRA36Ct). \nIt is important to note that *when using fiat, all transaction fees will be taken from your end. You have the next 72 hours from posting to claim fiat or you will default to KSM.*\n\n* **KSM** - Payment will take **up to 5 days**. Due to the ease of use (quick transaction time, no restrictions, and low fees), we strongly recommend choosing this payment method.\n\n**NOTE:** To claim in fiat, you'll need to cryptographically sign your message. To learn how to do that, see [this article](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/how-to-cryptographically-sign-a-message-18942).",

        "body": "On this week's episode of Artist Spotlight, we caught up with **ediv**, one of the most active artists in the Kusama NFT ecosystem. He lives in Southern California and has [minted 4 collections till date--Dedhorse, Dedhorse Drops, Paranoia at Sea, and Petri Dish](https://singular.rmrk.app/space/HnccMvwD4zsrG2mdyyiZvNCvDgMPZKrMA4BGHkT17c3KfkP?page=1&tab=created&creator=true).\n\nWe had a very illuminating discussion about NFTs, decentralization, RMRK 2.0, and many more. At some point, ediv even hits us with some philosophical thoughts. All in all, it was one of our best interviews here at RMRK.\n\n## Q: How did you get into crypto and NFTs?\n**ediv:**\n> Working as a web developer and just being in tech brought me into contact with crypto/blockchain. It was always hovering somewhere in the periphery, but I never bothered to look too closely for whatever reason. I think my initial impression was that crypto was just some sort of vaporware built on an overly redundant, coal-powered database. In its practical application, proof of work seemed absurd to me (still does), and because I took it to be synonymous with blockchain at the time, I was pretty dismissive.\n> \n> Meanwhile (unbeknownst to me) the industry kept on moving and all of this cool stuff was happening on Ethereum. It wasn’t until I heard about smart contracts, DAOs, proof of stake, Web3.0, and NFTs that I took a deeper look and saw the possibilities. I started playing around with Solidity and before long discovered Polkadot/Substrate, which blew me away and reinvigorated a passion and optimism regarding technology that had been more or less snuffed out over years spent modernizing legacy PHP applications. \n> \n> At that point, I was hooked and resolved to get into Blockchain full-time as soon as possible. I started spending more time on my side-hustle (art) experimenting with NFTs and went through the Substrate Runtime Dev Academy…and here I am today trying to find my place in crypto land.\n\n## Q: How many NFT platforms have you tried and what has your experience been like?\n**ediv:**\n> I’ve tried out Rarible, HEN, Foundation (tried at least), and of course RMRK. Overall, the experience has been both exciting and frustrating. You find yourself trying to navigate this tension between the novelty of the whole scene and the struggle for visibility. There are tons of talented, creative people trying to make the most of this new opportunity, but there is also a lot of low-effort garbage contributing to the noise. Regardless of where you’re minting, you only stand a chance of surviving the churn if you can manage to find your audience…and you can only find your audience if you can manage to get seen. Being invested in the Polkadot ecosystem already, I was drawn to the efforts to establish Kusama as a place for creatives. I saw minting w/ RMRK as a way to cut through the noise and get involved as an early contributor to the NFT culture on Kusama.\n\n## Q: What’s your favorite platform and why? It doesn’t have to be RMRK. We promise, won’t hold it against you.\n**ediv:**\n> Regardless of whether I have an opportunity to participate as a creator on them or not, I’m most excited about platforms that are trying new things. I look for projects extending the definition of what NFTs are by introducing custom logic and embedding them in engaging social experiences that set the stage for strange new emergent behaviors. Of course, this is another huge reason why RMRK is so exciting.\n> \n> Some big-name examples of this sort of thing are CryptoKitties, BAYC, even Hashmasks. More recently, I’ve been keeping an eye on Chain/Saw (chainsaw.fun), a smaller project on Ethereum working with a curated list of awesome artists to push the boundaries of NFTs. Looking forward to what they come up with.\n> \n> I think we’ll start to see the true potential of NFTs as more artists and creators move away from major NFT platforms to create their own projects/platforms that fuse custom logic with digital artwork to create new sorts of interactive art.\n> \n> So to bring it back to the question, my favorite platforms—the ones that I want to create and get involved with—are those that are built to express specific artistic visions. I think RMRK has the potential to be a very powerful tool in making this possible.\n\n## Q: What draws you to NFTs and decentralization? / Is it only about NFTs (and the money) or are you also big on the decentralization movement?\n**ediv:**\n> I’m a big believer in the benefits of decentralization. I have drunk the kool-aid. We are being driven to act against our well-being by profit-maximizing organizations that have weaponized the obscene amounts of data that they extract from our movements throughout web 2.0. Pardon my tinfoil hat, but this shit is downright terrifying. Whatever sort of free will we might have is likely to devolve under conditions where our actions are carefully dissected and fed back into this exhausting, AI-assisted feedback loop of surveillance and consumption. \n> \n> From where I’m standing, decentralization and the promise of Web 3.0 seem to give us a real shot at breaking this cycle. Specifically, within the Polkadot ecosystem, I’m very excited about the possibilities that come from the combination of forkless runtime upgrades and on-chain governance. This is a totally new way of creating applications that can grow and evolve in line with our best interests.\n> \n> NFTs are cool too. Similarly, they can redistribute the wealth extracted from this economy of eyeballs back to the eyeball holders themselves.\n\n## Q: Tell us about your creation process.\n**ediv:**\n> My favorite way to make stuff is by zoning out and free-handing until I end up with some forms and an idea that I can continue refining until it looks like something. Of course, this sort of thing takes forever and often doesn’t go anywhere useful. So, if I’ve got a commission, I start in a much more structured way doing the usual stuff like brainstorming concepts, sketching, and getting locked in on a design…but this is work. For me, the real pleasure of creating comes from taking the day to let my mind go and obsess over lines. If I end up with something that I think looks cool, even better.\n\n## Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**ediv:**\n> My objective is to carve out a little niche for myself that allows me to make a living by expressing myself through the combination of my code and my art. I want to work with interesting folks across the globe to advance the notion of what NFTs are.\n\n## Q: How do you see the NFT space shaping up?\n**ediv:**\n> A succession of bubbles growing and popping with each cycle leaving behind innovations that will gradually contribute to fundamental changes in how we understand and interact with art and technology.\n\n## Q: What are your thoughts on Kanaria?  (Do you own a Kanaria egg?)\n**ediv:**\n> I think Kanaria is awesome. The RMRK team has done a great job of finding a way to build out a proof of concept and demonstrate the possibilities of the protocol while at the same time securing funding to make sure they’ll be around to continue supporting it. \n> \n> Surprisingly, I don’t have an egg in my wallet at the moment. I had tried to grab some early on, but I’m in the US, so KYC stopped me at that point. I’m sure I could have found a way around this or picked up an egg through the P2P marketplace, but it never happened for whatever reason. I may try to jump in and save an egg from the burn, but overall I would say that my main focus has been investing in RMRK by experimenting with the platform with my own artwork, trying to be active in the community, and talking about it with other artists.\n\n## Q: Any ideas for how you will you use the immense power of RMRK 2.0 in your work?\n**ediv:**\n> I’ve been kicking a few ideas around, but one that I’m thinking of starting out with takes advantage of nested NFTs to riff on the formula introduced by CryptoPunks and extended by Kanaria in which some set of visual attributes (with varying levels of rarity) are combined to create a bunch of unique characters. Instead of offering up these unique characters for sale directly, we deconstruct the whole thing so that users must first collect a set of NFTs representing attributes (eyes, mouths, etc.) individually and then combine them together to create their own characters. Just like the precedent established by Kanaria, these characters will be implemented as NFTs owning all of the child NFTs that represent their constituent parts. A P2P secondary market would then allow for the trading of entire characters or the swapping of individual parts. \n> \n> The artwork for this project is based around these cartoon bombs/warheads I’ve been doing (example below). \n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/TlGjA0c.jpg)\n \n> My working title for the project is ‘Build-a-Bomb’, but this is subject to change if the authorities object to my sense of humor. Once RMRK makes its way to chains that allow for additional on-chain logic to be introduced, additional mechanics can be added, e.g. maybe fiddling with your bomb to swap out in some fancy uranium eyeballs carries some chance of the thing blowing up (getting burned) in your face, thereby increasing the value of bombs that make it through upgrades/adjustments. Who’s in!?\n\nWe enjoyed our chat with **ediv** and are looking forward to his exciting use of RMRK 2.0. We hope you found the interview as insightful as we did. \n\nUntil next week. \n\n**Which artist will you like us to interview in future?

Forever encased in an ashy tomb of blistering heat, the Kanaria that never hatch are thrown into the fires of Hou-ou so that others may live in this crossover of Nordic Jul Festivities into Japanese Canary birds.\n\n**The last few days from June 27th to June 30th will be Sudden Death mode, high flammambility. Every unsaved egg will burn 5 additional eggs of its type alongside it.**\n\nBut you can change this. You can alter their fate, give them love and the family they deserve. You can SAVE them.\n\n## Saving Birds\n\nAt the bottom of the Kanaria home page, you will now see a list of eggs designated for burning - the ones with the fire backgrounds. As you save them, you climb the leaderboard. As each countdown reaches 0, the unsaved eggs burn. If all eggs are saved before the countdown reaches 0, the next batch is queued up.\n\n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/bvYKQD9j/image.png)\n\n## Why Save?\n\nApart from, well, spreading love and family values, the other reward you get for saving the eggs is a special Midsommar theme on the bird that will eventually hatch.\n\nAll saviors get a wonderful wreath to equip as headgear (if your bird rolls headgear as part of the regular hatching process, it gets BOTH). The top 10 saviors get a very rare tradable Midsommar background too, and the Prime Savior also gets a megawreath. Example of background and regular wreath below!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zspIrXj.jpg)\n\n## How to Save?\n\nGo to [Kanaria's home page](https://kanaria.rmrk.app) and claim one of the burning eggs. If there are no eggs of the rarity level you want (e.g. there are only rares left, or only LEs), wait until the timer expires or the eggs are all saved to see a new set. That's it! Applying the reward is automatic when the birds hatch!",

Like many crypto artists in the space, he found NFTs through the help of a friend and since then he's never looked back.\n\nIt was an interesting interview and you can read it below.\n\n## Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Shiba Tales:**\n> A friend told me to research what non-fungible tokens were and for an artist creator like myself, I found it exciting to stumble on a new source of income for my art. From there, I learned a little more about the variables and other systems at play that influence crypto, being a fly on the wall and paying attention to the conversations around me, and trying to make sense of all the data collection.\n\n## Q: What has you experience with NFT platforms been like?\n**Shiba Tales:**\n> Some light research revealed that successful crypto artists diversified their point of sale through several ethereum-based marketplaces, so I followed suit initially. We have a handful of artworks on OpenSea, Rarible, and portion.io under the name \"shibatales\". We sold some work which has been encouraging, but not enough to quit our day jobs. That's why I'm working so hard to be the best in both worlds (art and engineering), so that I can build a platform for our project Shiba Tales that blends NFT art and gaming with 3D and interactivity.\n\n## Q: What’s your favorite platform and why? It doesn’t have to be RMRK. We promise, won’t hold it against you.\n**Shiba Tales:**\n> Singular/RMRK! I love working with the team and I see the endless possibilities of their NFT standard being adopted by many projects, whether on Kusama or not. \n\n## Q: What keeps you in NFTs? Money or decentralization?\n**Shiba Tales:**\n> At first, it was about that other source of income, but as I continue to learn more about web 3.0 tech and decentralization, I want to be part of this space for the long haul and lend my skills and talents to see it mature even further. \n\n## Q: What is your creative process like?\n**Shiba Tales:**\n> I have a traditional art background so paper and pencil sketches have a place in my heart. I use a suite of digital tools to make my creations come to life, one of them being procreate and an Apple pencil. My husband and I collaborate a lot, and we draw inspiration from one another and our Shiba Inus, so our next frontier of learning will take us deeper into the world of 3D animation, AI, and generative art. \n\n## Q: How do you see the NFT space shaping up?\n**Shiba Tales:**\n> Honestly, the first initial waves of the NFT craze were an adrenaline-filled, heart-pumping experience. Right now, though most of these NFTs (especially on Ethereum) are only collecting digital dust, and you'd be met with extremely high gas fee costs for general transactions. With the work on web 3.0 technologies that I've encountered on the Kusama blockchain, I'm excited to see the work of the many RMRK partnerships come to fruition and transform NFTs into art legos.\n\n## Q: Do you own a Kanaria egg? / thoughts on Kanaria\n**Shiba Tales:**\n> I own 2 Kanaria eggs! I don't remember their numbers atm and I hardly have any emojis on them! Kanaria has been a wonderful experience and that's how I was introduced to the RMRK team in the first place. I'm very honored to help create drawings for the top 40 art contests, as well as coming up with early prototypes for the composable birds.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed the interview.\n\nUntil next week.\n\n**Which artist will you like us to interview in future?

        "body": "Hello all, I'll make this short but here's an even shorter TLDR:\n\n- we're allowing hatching throughout July\n- 2.0 functionality will get a tiered release, not all-at-once (probably not news but good to be clear)\n- the token **might not** happen on July 1st, but will happen as soon as it's **technically** possible. It depends Statemine becoming permissionless, no one is able to mint tokens on it right now and we don't know how far off this functionality is.\n- due to some late entries and very few votes across the board the art contest voting period is being extended for 1 week. Submission still ends on June 30.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aWNNQD3.png)\n\nIn the interest of full transparency, details below.\n\n## Art Contest Voting Extension\n\nWe will be leaving the voting on the [Art Contest](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/artcontest) open until July 7th due to some late entries and too few votes.\n\nSubmissions still end on June 30th, so get your art in, but also remember that with every new vote the pot grows for everyone, so even as just a voter it is in your best interest to ask people to vote and spread the word!\n\nThe period from July 8th to July 15th will be focused on plagiarism detection, and cheating winners will be disqualified with runners up winning instead etc.\n\n## Hatching Extension\n\nWe've had so many new users late in the game who were completely uninitialized that we now have **well over half** the eggs hatchable but not hatching. People are still asking what emotes are, and how to hatch, or what the eggs are even about. Many founders (over a third!) also didn’t hatch yet, which would be a terrible loss, as we have some beautiful artworks lined up. They might have been affected by the bear market, perhaps their focus is elsewhere, maybe they had work on, an illness, or simply forgot to be active.\n\nThe art we've lined up is truly amazing, all commissioned and paid for - more than 30 artists contributed.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/EOHy6W7.png)](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1405563867854524417?s=20)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/XesC6ph.png)](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1408757813111930882?s=20)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/Tbs4wyL.png)](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1409066694362996737?s=20)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/NwQpOub.png)](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1409423571143868416)\n\n\nWe always said we would extend the hatching period if the percentage of unhatched hatchables is high and this seems to have come true - 40% going to waste would be a tragedy. We will continue to allow hatching throughout July, but that's it - **no further extensions**.\n\nPeople who hatch in July will get a **penalty** on their emotes, meaning the longer you wait, the less of an effect your emotes will have. The [reverse of this](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/old-young-early-eggdopter-probability-bonus-18367). That means you still get the best results by clicking Hatch in June. Likewise, **for every week in July that passes, you lose one [Bird trait](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/kanaria-nft-demystified-what-am-i-actually-getting-18506) and the accompanying slot rots.**\n\n**EXCEPTION: IF YOU CLAIMED YOUR EGG(S) ON OR AFTER JUNE 23RD, THE PENALTY IS DELAYED FOR YOU BY 1 WEEK**\n\nExample: you hatched your 3-trait bird on July 4th, and the bird rolled \"Rev Share\" and \"Secondary art\". The third trait would, [as per this post](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/kanaria-nft-demystified-what-am-i-actually-getting-18506), be a trait voucher. However in this case, this trait slot will remain empty and you will NOT get a free trait and the slot it would have been equipped in will be forever ruined (a late-birth defect). If you hatched this same bird on July 12th, you would get 2 empty slots, and would lose the \"Secondary art\" trait.\n\n> Note 🚨 Hatching on June 30th does NOT get you penalized, even if your bird appears in July. Hatching on July 31st still hatches your bird, even though it will appear in August, so don't worry about losing it.\n\n## 2.0 Functionality Tiered Release\n\nKanaria took a **lot** out of us in the past few weeks, especially as new partnerships came on board and we started working closely with projects that will put RMRK on some serious maps, **benefiting the whole project and all tokenholders later**.\n\nThe art contest's filtering, UI building, multimedia support, and general technical support have also taken at least a week of collective dev-time away from us.\n\nWith bug fixes and feature upgrades across the board, optimizations, and these partnerships - which we know you'll love - we don't want to do a rushed launch with tech debt that would hold us prisoner for years to come and unnecessarily increase burn rate.\n\nThis is something we assumed was implied but maybe communicated badly, so we want to be explicit here: **the 2.0 functionality launch will be tiered** - features will be released a feature at a time rather than all at once. This will give us time to test each part thoroughly before moving to the next. The idea is still to have full [Dawn](https://url.rmrk.app/dawn) functionality ready throughout July though, except tokenization which needs on-chain logic as specified in the post.\n\n**A tiered release does NOT affect token distribution. Read below**.\n\n## Token Delay\n\nWe were expecting to launch the token on or before July 1st, and allow people to claim the tokens immediately (or as soon as we build the UI for this). However, this depends on when Parity makes Statemine, the chain we're launching the token on, permissionless (it is currently permissioned and not just anyone can mint on it).\n\nAs soon as this happens we will mint the tokens and allow distribution. You will be able to withdraw from a special UI we build for this purpose. Exchange listings will follow closely.\n\nSo while the exact date of the token minting is unknown and out of our hands, **we will do it as soon as we are technically able**, and **hopefully** on-schedule, beginning of July.\n\n## What about token snapshot, sale, egg burning?\n\nEverything remains as planned:\n\n- token snapshot is on July 1st, noon CET. Buying an egg p2p after that date does NOT grant you tokens.\n- sale ends June 30th, as planned. RMRK team will have no more eggs to sell you.\n- all unsold eggs will have been burned by the end of June 30th.\n\n\nThanks for understanding, see you on the other side!",

        "body": "No, it's not the title of a bad 80s Kung-fu flick. It's Kanaria's (and RMRK's) next phase.\n\nOur [Initial Collectible Offering](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/kanaria-rmrk-s-initial-collectible-offering-7078) closed on June 30th, and what a ride it's been. We managed to [break](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8963) Kusama itself [*twice*](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9240), launched two platforms - [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app) and [Kanaria](https://kanaria.rmrk.app) - and while we've been developing the [core](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-tools/pull/66) of the [most advanced NFT system in the world](https://url.rmrk.app/dawn) we commissioned 99 custom artworks, ran the [first non-runtime DAO on Kusama and probably the first ever NFT-DAO](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/kanaria-dao-proposal-1-results-16541), established partnerships with almost all of the heavy hitters in the Kusama ecosystem, are still running an [art contest](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/artcontest) for 40 custom artworks, and are working together with major players from the Ethereum world on bridges, reimplementations, and stronger standardization.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ysnmNOK.png)\n\nIn total, [the fires of Hou-ou](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/the-fires-of-hou-ou-18600) ended up consuming 1185 out of 9000 Limited Edition eggs and 153 out of 900 Rares. Yes, the rares missed their last bonus by only 3 eggs :(\n\nNeedless to say, the claim exceeded our wildest expectations. In the beginning even 50% was a distant dream, but with a unique sale angle, working products, and a good vision, we've proven that we can create demand and establish symbiotic relationships across the entire ecosystem.\n\nThe burned eggs contained 1171521.0356 $RMRK, or 11.7152% of the total supply. With growing CEX interest and 88% of the tokens in the hands of the community, this means our original [tokenomics](https://url.rmrk.app/wp-pub) plan needs a revamp - more on that in a separate post as we get our bearings and decide what to do.\n\n## Snapshot and Token Allocations\n\nThe token allocation snapshot took place on July 1st, noon CET. Here's what this means:\n\n- every account that held eggs on July 1st noon CET has been assigned a token allocation based on these eggs. The allocation is visible at [kanaria.rmrk.app/tokens][k].\n- you can now send the eggs around, sell them, destroy them, hatch them - your token allocation will remain unchanged.\n- **if you lost access to the account which had eggs on July 1st, noon CET, you HAVE LOST ACCESS TO YOUR TOKENS. We will NOT be moving the allocation to a new account because it is not possible to prove that you owned that account.**\n- the tokens will be minted as soon as Statemine, the chain on which we will be minting them, is permissionless and we're allowed to mint.\n- [the tokens will be distributed automatically](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/an-update-on-rmrk-token-claims-19091).\n\n## Stats\n\nWe have 1711 individual egg holders, with an average of 5 eggs per holder. Here's what the curve of eggs per holder looks like:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DQOhsSY.png)\n\nIn total, people have sent in 1'200'000 emotes with an average of 121 per egg. Before Kusama's fees were reduced, we spent a total of 54KSM on emotes, and after another 78KSM at 50x less cost 😱\n\nOf all 8661 claimed eggs, 7971 are hatching at this moment. 217 accounts seem to have completely forgotten about Kanaria (they only have unhatched eggs), effectively forgetting about a 3086 KSM (~$600,000 based on an exchange rate of $200 per KSM).\n\nOf the 99 Founder eggs, 90 are hatching and 9 are rotting (fingers crossed they survive! 🤞).\n\nIn terms of our partnerships and referral links:\n\n- Unifty leads the way with a whopping 4 Founder eggs, 6 Rares and 94 (!!) Limited Edition eggs. Lots of [unicorn birds](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmr-kable-unifty-birds-14809)!\n- Bifrost is the runner-up with 17 Rares and 102 Limited Editions! Looks like people [really want Huginn and Muninn](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1408096840814366721?s=20), and who could blame them with looks that cool!\n  [![](https://i.imgur.com/LlzuXN0.png)](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1408096840814366721)\n- Acala: 9 Rares and 146 Limited Editions, opening the door to [collateralized Kanaria birds and RMRK farming with yield from fungibilized Kanara in DeFi](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/karura-x-rmrk-de-fi-meets-nf-ts-16860).\n- Unique Network: 2 Rares and 160 Limited Editions, showing that people REALLY care about [cross-project equippable NFTs](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1403002304500887557?s=20).\n- [Khala](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-and-phala-form-strategic-partnership-16670): 3 Rares and 50 Limited Editions. They're also offering [some fancy gems](https://twitter.com/PhalaNetwork/status/1410431733481148417?s=20) 😱\n- Zeitgeist: 2 Rares and 53 Limited Editions, a total of [55 birds ready to predict the future](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-and-zeitgeist-predict-the-future-together-16596).\n- Bit.country: 2 Rares and 70 Limited Editions, clearly indicating people want to reuse their RMRK NFTs [inside of metaverses](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/upgrading-the-metaverse-bit-country-rmrk-17794)!\n- [Plasm](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/plasm-s-shiden-and-rmrk-s-kanaria-join-forces-18153): 39 Limited Editions.\n\nAdditionally,\n\n2 Rares and 57 Limited Edition eggs were claimed after [this tweet](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1410155268961353731?s=20), increasing their chances for Polkadot and Kusama related visuals, whereas the 2 Rare and 46 Limited Edition eggs purchased after one of the Hou-ou tweets ([1](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1409945804442329089), [2](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1407239602709094400?s=20), [3](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1406597881692409874?s=20), [4](https://twitter.com/RmrkApp/status/1394648819720232962?s=20)) will get an increased chance for fire-related visuals.\n\nThank you all for being a part of this journey - it's far from over, and I hope you'll join us on the rest!\n\n[k]: https://kanaria.rmrk.app/tokens",

You can read the whole thing [in this PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ujwxtDZdNPb9V2zpL5iH--1Zy9ihCQPf/view?usp=sharing) but in a nutshell, a virtual 3D restoration of an archeological site / museum by the people for the people, immortalized in the real world, but also virtually as a set of nested, interactive NFTs.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of thing RMRK's system should make possible and we hope to help them bring this into reality during 2021.\n\nTeaser video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXQs3zggjg0\n\n## BtcMacroecon: Dog Rescue\n\nUser btcmacroecon submitted a whopping 7 ideas. While some didn't really need blockchain at all, one stood out: Dog Rescue NFTs. I'll paraphrase it here, and add some of my own flair on top to round the idea out.\n\nDog Rescue NFTs are NFTs representing a pup in a shelter you cannot physically adopt, but can take care of remotely - at least financially, until adopted. Even in kill shelters, a pup who's been bought as an NFT is basically having its \"rent\" paid by the owner, who will also continuously pay \"tax\" on the NFT covering medical costs and food, and in return get progress photos as additional resources on this NFT. This pup NFT can evolve until adopted, at which point your \"mission\" as the NFT owner is complete, and you add a saved pup to your collection of digital pets, while the real counterpart is hopefully in a new loving home.\n\n## milojkoviclaz: Drag Race\n\nParaphrasing the suggestion and adding embellishment to round it out:\n\nCar NFTs that are equippable with different wheels, body parts, decals, each with a different rarity level. A track is another NFT which is also a DAO, with tokenholders deciding the duration and type of the race, rules, and more. The whole experience can turned into a prediction market by integrating with something like [Zeitgeist](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-and-zeitgeist-predict-the-future-together-16596). Users could also stake $RMRK on the wins.\n\nI like this one because it takes composability into account properly, but also keeps the utility of $RMRK tokens in mind, which wasn't really the focus of many of the submissions.\n\n## Peter.mahne95: Music DAO\n\nTaking the music example from the [Dawn](https://url.rmrk.app/dawn) post several steps further, Peter suggests collective composition of an entirely new type:\n\n> We want to create the first music record label DAO. The way most modern music is made today is by a collaborative effort from creators all around the world which often like to turn on each other once the money & ‘middle men’ come in. \n> \n> We could aim to create the first decentralized NFT single by letting the DAO vote on which addition to the single is approved. Sample producers would create samples (melodies), drum producers would add drums, song writers record a demo to it, artists record on it etc. \n> \n> The DAO would vote on which samples are fire or trash. The DAO would be made of musicians only, split into groups based on which creative process they’re part of (sampler, drummer, song writer, artist, mix engineer, graphic designer). \n> \n> Every time there’s an action required by a DAO member (create or vote) it would be incentivized with DAO token rewards. The DAO would need to be big so we have community effect on everything we do so we could have an ‘official’ roster of only the best musicians that ‘season’. \n> \n> At the end of the season, new roster is voted. Each applicant for the roster has to meet certain requirements (minimum activity within DAO). The roster could have a salary based on DAO fund and every musician would benefit greatly, as it would be a nice opportunity to prove themselves.\n\nThe idea needs fleshing out but is definitely doable and for sure interesting to musicians around the world who want to collaborate in a remote way and share revenue from their globally accessible work.\n\n## jondang00: Memorabilia\n\nAgain paraphrasing and rounding out with some of my own thoughts.\n\nAn upgrade to the NFT-as-event-ticket model, these NFTs could contain special key moments from the performance, additional information, and bonuses as metadata - redeemable vouchers for swag, food, extra content, more tickets. The bonuses could be tradable, but not usable without being equipped by a ticket, so there's a secondary living economy for an event *well after the event*, kind of like what we're trying to do with Kanaria's flocking.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine attending a Lady Gaga concert and then adding value to your ticket after the concert is gone by being the only one with the first publicly released video segment in which she throws up and just keeps going. If the segment is yours and/or carries copyright too, it becomes much more than a Top Shots style NFT of an event and turns into a Big-Media-tradable item as the publishers start vying for the right to include your segment in their news.\n\n## Honorable Mentions\n\nThese entries didn't make the final cut, but still get an LE each for the effort.\n\n- A well thought out monster trading card game by user spamking\n- A Kanaria reincarnation game by cryptodmeme\n- Evolvable land deeds by crispskies and Reuse-with-trust (evolvable car pink slips) by hvelayos\n- Digital Barbies, a very comprehensive clone of Kanaria by tsaiminfon\n- A physi-digital collection of upgradeable wearables (Nike collections etc) by melanie050691\n- Asset-backed securities by ngmegan1989\n- Algo filters and composable digital photos by taylortap\n- Nested financial options by yattatt\n\n\nThank you all for participating - we truly have the best community!

        "body": "As on any NFT platform, there is plagiarism on RMRK's Singular platform.\n\nUntil we add community-curation and other filtering features, we expect the buyers to be diligent and do research before purchasing.\n\nJust like you would Google a project's team or history before buying their token, you should research the person whose NFTs you're purchasing, or at least look into the NFTs themselves.\n\nThe RMRK team has decided to hide works from minters that are verified plagiarisms. The NFT is still on chain and another UI can choose to show it, but we will not.\n\nThere will be no refunds for purchases of plagiarized content.\n\n## How to Check for Plagiarized Content\n\nTo help combat plagiarism, we implemented a Reverse Image Search button next to all static-image NFTs.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrLerEG.png)\n\nClicking it will open a new tab with reverse-image-search results for that NFT's art, at which point you can compare the results.\n\nYou will be unable to purchase an NFT on Singular before you first manually check the box that confirms you have looked into the NFT. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qkrPJ4z.png)\n\n### Example 1\n\nHere is an example. Let's take [this NFT](https://singular.rmrk.app/collectibles/7923930-78e79bcb474a9fdf6d-FJR4N-WAY_OF_THE_SAMURAI-0000000000000001):\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SG5ZSV5.png)\n\nWe will see that clicking the button opens a new tab.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xudsVwW.png)\n\nThis NFT is by [Arkcyu](https://www.deviantart.com/arckyu), one of the [Kanaria](https://kanaria.rmrk.app) Founder bird artists.\n\n### Example 2\n\nHere's another example. [This 3D render](https://singular.rmrk.app/collectibles/8185402-cef5911a62f481096f-HFGL8-2-0000000000000001).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Qvms7fO.jpg)\n\nThis render is not found by Bing, which might give you the impression of it being safe.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/deiyDT9.jpg)\n\nHowever, these reverse image searches are not always 100% accurate, and it's usually worth it to check multiple services. [Tineye.com](https://tineye.com) is another such service where you can just paste an image in after right clicking it in Singular and selecting \"Copy Image\".\n\nLooking it up there, we see that the first occurrence is in July 2013.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QjcKZML.png)\n\nThis leads us to this person's Deviantart profile, at which point we have two choices: either ignore this art as likely plagiarized, or contact the owner of the Deviantart profile and check if it's them minting this. Our guess would be no, since the NFT's image has a watermark in the bottom right corner, but we have not *confirmed* the plagiarism so the piece is not yet hidden.\n\n### What about animations and MP4?\n\nIf we check this [SailorMoon NFT](https://singular.rmrk.app/collectibles/7789025-0488b1a94fd8d61738-BISHOUJO-WINNER_OF_JUPITER-0000000000000013), we'll notice it's animated. Tineye cannot reverse search images from videos, so in this case, you would need to do it manually.\n\nThe process would be:\n\n- take a screenshot of the part of the screen where the NFT is (SHIFT + WINDOWS KEY + S in Windows, SHIFT + COMMAND + 4 on Mac)\n- paste this screenshot into [Tineye.com](https://tineye.com) or [Bing](https://bing.com), on Windows you can just hit CTRL+V while on the Tineye page, on Mac you need to manually upload the file.\n- observe the results, as this example on Tineye.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Khtau22.png)\n\nIn this particular case, we know for a fact that this art is genuine and owned by the minter (it's the excellent [Shiba Tales](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-artist-spotlight-5-shiba-tales-and-glare-of-nf-ts-18690)), so we can feel safe.\n\n## What will Curation look like?\n\nThere are two planned stages for curation.\n\n### Stage 1: Community Curation and Reputation\n\nIn the first stage, we will implement Reddit-like curation where:\n\n- newly minted NFTs will only appear on a special \"New\" page.\n- users will be able to vote on the NFTs, weighted similarly to the [art contest weights](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/kanaria-art-contest-voting-weights-and-deadline-extension-18343). The more active / loyal a user, the more weight your vote carries - this is your on-chain reputation.\n- negatively voted works will not show up in search results or on the home page.\n- positively voted works (past a certain threshold of votes-per-person-and-type to prevent self-voting) will be shown on the home page and in search results.\n- highly upvoted works will be selected for the Curated section.\n- strongly downvoted NFTs will be flagged for RMRK team's attention, prompting a ban of the minter.\n\nIt's important to note that different accounts will start off different. Total anons (no [eggs/birds](https://kanaria.rmrk.app), no Singular participation, no RMRK tokens, no identity defined on the Kusama blockchain) will start lower on the points scale, whereas someone with a verified identity on Kusama might start off with 10 points on every NFT they mint. \n\nIt is in the minter's best interest to be a good and active participant of the Kusama and RMRK ecosystem to have a well built and highly reputable account to mint with.\n\n### Stage 2: RMRK-staked Curation\n\nWhen RMRK's token launches and we have logic deployed on chains like Acala's Karura, we will implement a staking mechanic as such:\n\n- to mint, you will need to stake a small amount of RMRK tokens\n- if your NFT goes unreported for a specific amount of time, you get your stake back and the NFT starts showing up on home pages and search pages\n- reporting an NFT requires a stake of RMRK tokens too\n- once the report is resolved, the loser loses his stake (is fully slashed), the winner gets 10% of the slashed amount.\n\nThis system will **augment** community curation - staking the tokens would allow you to bypass the reputation and voting requirement, instead propelling you directly to the homepage and search result pages without needing upvotes.",

        "body": "With NFTs on a meteoric rise, there’s never been a better time to be a crypto artist. The most difficult thing for any crypto artist is deciding which platform(s) to mint their magnificent works on. This article explains why [RMRK's Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/) is one of (if not) the best minting destination for forward-thinking crypto artists. This is because the RMRK NFT standard is the most advanced NFT standard, unlocking an explosion of use cases for NFTs. \nBelow are 5 reasons why [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/) is perfect for you.\n\n## 1. Mint NFTs with low fees\nThanks to Kusama’s architecture, minting an NFT on Singular costs only 2 cents. To help artists get started with minting, we are offering 500 free mints to qualified artists. If you want to try the platform, please apply using [this form](https://forms.gle/xkHinMb4NDt5FGQg6). Because we view Singular as a home for terrific, advanced art, the only criteria is that we are impressed by your artistry. \n\n## 2. Mint upgradeable NFTs (nested NFTs + conditional rendering)\nWith this feature, you can create NFTs that own other NFTs. One way this can be utilized is to have a [parent bird NFT](https://url.rmrk.app/demobird) that has two accessories (hat and cape) in the form of child NFTs. Thus, the bird NFT will have 4 different viewing possibilities. Which image to show will depend on the number of child NFTs equipped.\n\n> Possibility 1 - Bird \n> \n> Possibility 2 - Bird + Hat\n> \n> Possibility 3 - Bird + Cape\n> \n> Possibility 4 - Bird + Hat + Cape\n\nWhen the NFT owner equips the Hat child NFT on-chain, the bird NFT will change to possibility 2. This is called conditional rendering and every NFT minted on Singular can utilize this feature. \nAs the artist, you would have the opportunity to grow revenue by creating newer versions of old works by using equippable child NFTs. For example, backgrounds can now be designed and sold as add-ons to old works. \nA traditional mode of release would be an add-on child NFT plus a new resource which is the blend of the new child NFT (background or accessory) and the old NFT. \n\n## 3. Mint smart NFTs with multi-resource capability (JPG, MP4, PDF, MP3, 3D, etc.)\nNFTs should be smart, knowing how to present themselves depending on where they are called up. For example, on a viewing platform like Singular, you expect to see a high definition 2D version of your NFT. But this doesn’t mean that your NFT can only be in 2D.  An NFT of a 3D model can have a resource that is a 3D model file, a resource that is a high resolution image, and a resource that is a thumbnail image. Depending on the context it is being loaded into, a different resource will be loaded. \nWith the RMRK plugin, a 3D tool like Sketchup or 3DS Max can load the 3D file directly, listing on Singular can show the high res image in single-item view, and on the search results page the thumbnail can automatically be shown. To take it further, an audio NFT can have a PDF resource attached to it. This PDF can represent the lyrics or a note from the music artist. \n\n## 4. Use emote functionality for price discovery \nOn singular, NFTs can receive emojis. Because there is a small cost attached to sending emojis, each emote is valuable. This helps with price discovery as the number of emotes gathered by an NFT will reflect its popularity with people, thus informing your valuation of NFTs.\n\n## 5. Mint multi-chain compatible NFTs\nAll NFTs minted on Singular can be teleported to any Substrate-based chain in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems (with the condition that the chain has implemented RMRK’s standard.) Already, [Unique Network](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/10/2245300/0/en/Unique-Network-and-RMRK-Partner-to-Showcase-Next-Generation-NFT-Technology.html), [Acala](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/karura-x-rmrk-de-fi-meets-nf-ts-16860), [Phala](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-and-phala-form-strategic-partnership-16670), [Bit.Country](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/upgrading-the-metaverse-bit-country-rmrk-17794), [Zeitgeist](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/rmrk-and-zeitgeist-predict-the-future-together-16596), [Plasm](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/plasm-s-shiden-and-rmrk-s-kanaria-join-forces-18153), and [Bifrost](https://app.subsocial.network/@rmrkapp/announcement-rmrk-hops-onto-bifrost-for-a-fast-lane-to-18482) have pledged (via partnerships) to be RMRK compatible. That means that your NFT can teleport from Kusama to Acala to gain DeFi capability, then to Bit.Country to have fun or attend a meeting in the metaverse. With 100 parachains planned for Polkadot and Kusama within the next five years, endless possibilities abound for all Singular-minted NFTs.\n\n## Conclusion — become a pioneer\nThanks to RMRK functionality, Singular is not just another NFT minting platform. It is at the bleeding edge in NFT technology, and minting your art (music, 3D sketch, VR experience, etc.) there makes you a pioneer at the forefront of the NFT revolution. What could be better than that?\nGo to [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/) to get started, or [apply](https://forms.gle/xkHinMb4NDt5FGQg6) to get your first 500 mint transactions sponsored by RMRK!",

But we're back baby!\n\nOn this week's episode of RAS (RMRK Artist Spotlight) we interview **Erphan Malek**, one of the most talented artists we've met. Doubt us? Check out some of his works below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iwTVdMF.jpg)\n\n\nErphan is a 32-year-old Iranian digital artist and illustrator who started his career as an enviroment and chararter designer for animated series. He is a big time game lover who's had a dream of creating his own game since he was a kid. The vibrancy and dynamism one senses from his work seems to bear the outward fruits of this desire.\n\nWe chatted about his foray into crypto and NFTs, his favorite work, his art creation process, and more. Read the interview below.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> I first saw the *OpenSea* website by chance but didn’t know how to sell my work there. Later on, a good friend sent me a Foundation invite and taught me how to mint my works there.\n\n### Q: What is your favorite art creation (personal or client)?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> [My Monuments](https://foundation.app/@erphanmalek) collection is one of my favorite personal projects. The combination of architecture with different faces tells a story that involves the audience emotionally. This is why the collection is special to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Piuwshl.jpg)\n\n\n### Q: What has being in the NFT space shown you that you would not have seen if you were still outside? \n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Before getting acquainted with NFTs, I never knew we had lots of good artists, particularly in my country. I found so many new artists and made friends with them. The fascinating this is that each of them has their own worldview and the way they present their work. Seeing these varieties of artwork is really attractive to me.\n\n\n\n### Q: What is your creation process like?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Normally, it starts with an idea and then I start making some simple schemes on paper. I usually set it down in two or three different schemes before choosing the one with the best formation and shape. Then I add more details using software and, if needed, make some necessary changes. When I'm satisfied with what I have, then I start the final performance.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K71jG15.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q: What are your inspirations?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> I get ideas from almost everything. I can be inspired by nature, animals, my experiences, people I meet, or books I read. I am also inspired by art in the form of animation and movies I watch.\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> Although I have created many works in the past, I've never made any decent income with them. But with NFTs and the many available platforms now my artworks have the chance to be seen and collected by so many people. Thankfully, I work in different styles and my plan is to dedicate the various styles to different platforms. My works are currently on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/erphanmalek), [Hic Et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1MLJf8TkAZ7gY5jCmNoCauVYZ2cWBsFdfe/creations), and [Art Station](https://www.artstation.com/erphanmalek).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XC7qISw.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q: What’s your favorite platform and why? It doesn’t have to be RMRK. We promise, won’t hold it against you.\n**Erphan Malek:**\n> My favorite Nft platform is Hic Et Nunc because of its culture. \nOften, artists collect artworks and support each other. I have not seen many collectors there.\n\n\n### Q: What are your honest thoughts on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/)?\n\n> I think it's very user-friendly and has an excellent UI. I have not used many platforms yet but I think Singular is one of the best.\n\n\n*Check out Erphan's Princess Mononoke NFT on [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app/collectibles/8241121-a083f5bc1cc13d4e2a-GCNNY-PRINCESSMONONOKE-0000000000000001).*\n\n---\n\nOur biggest takeway from this interview is how detailed Erphan's creation process is. It perfectly explains why his art is so striking. Thank heavens for Bitcoin, which gave us Ethereum, that granted us NFTs, which exposed us to Erphan's artistic brilliance.\n\nWe had a good time chatting with Erphan and we hope you enjoyed reading it too. Until next week.

        "body": "On this week's episode of Artist Spotlight, we caught up with **Nuetosis**, the creator of the first-of-its-kind storified NFT series [Reapers v Androids](https://opensea.io/collection/reapers). \n\nThe story of the **Reapers v Androids** is told through art, online social media battles, and various other methods still in development. The cardholders are able to steer the story through battles, wars, character transformations, and creating new characters.\n\nRead the interview to learn more about this groundbreaking series and the man that created it.\n\n### Q: Tell us about yourself.\n**Nuetosis:**\n> I am a US-based artist who works as a full-time graphic designer, art director, and illustrator. I’ve been in the industry for over 25 years, and have won a lot of awards for both traditional and digital works.\n\n\n### Q: How did you get into NFTs?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> Earlier this year, I kept seeing the word NFT mentioned and didn’t know what it was. I looked into it and couldn’t understand it. Looked into it later, still didn’t understand it. Eventually, I began to comprehend and realize it’s potential. I jumped in hard and with everything I could muster.\n\n\n### Q: Tell us about Reapers vs Androids?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> I believe it is a groundbreaking storytelling NFT series. The story of the Reapers vs. Androids is told through art, online social media battles, and various other methods in development. You obtain your Reapers vs. Androids (among others) character and utility NFTs and you can help steer the story through battles, wars, character transformations, and even by creating new characters. Throughout, we will discover some of the mysteries of this fantastical, exciting, and complex world.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nDmsM5J.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q: How did you stumble on the idea for RvA?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> I enjoy creating fantasy worlds in my head with characters, settings, plots, etc. A few years ago I created one of these worlds in order to make a graphic novel within it. Ever since I try to fit all my creations into that world in various time frames in its history. Currently, in this NFT collection, the world is in it’s 2nd post-apocalyptic phase. In a time after the last human has died, the earth is being ruled by the Androids and the Reapers. In this world, almost anything is possible. Is there a limit to creativity?\n\n### Q: We understand what Androids are, but the Reapers we can’t quite figure out. Can you explain what they are?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> They all started as Androids. Reapers are Androids with their faceplates removed, lost, destroyed, or stolen. Because of this, the Reapers were treated differently in their society. They were seen as lesser beings. Eventually, fed up with tyranny and maltreatment, as they saw it, a rebellion formed. \n\n\n### Q: Do you see more storified NFT projects like RvA launching in the future?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> I hope so. Mostly I’m seeing a lot of copycat projects in an attempt to ‘ride the wave’. I’m in it for the long run. Slow and steady.\n\n\n### Q: What would success look like for RvA?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> Lots of people involved and participating in online battles, one-on-one random encounters, gladiator fights, and more. Then onto graphic novels, prequels, games, and eventually a call from Netflix.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F771W9g.jpg)\n\n### Q: How many NFT platforms have you tried and what has your experience been like?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> Rarible (too messy), Foundation (crickets chirping...), OpenSea (is doing the basics for me), HEN (impossible, but has potential).\n\n\n### Q: What’s your favorite platform and why? It doesn’t have to be RMRK. We promise, won’t hold it against you.\n**Nuetosis:**\n> OpenSea so far as it is helping me get RvA out. I need a web developer though as I’d like to increase the potential.\n\n\n### Q: What is your creation process like?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> I start in my own head. Usually 40-50% of the time. When I get an idea, I think about it 24-7 until I’ve either worked it into the trash, or sculpted it into a viable option. Once I think it is viable, I go at it very hard, drawing/painting night and day, hardly taking any breaks. In my head, the idea must get out. This NFT space moves very fast.\n\n\n### Q: What are your goals in the NFT space?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> I just want people to be involved with my stories. I’ve always loved reading and watching fantasy-type things. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Narnia, DnD, etc. Yeah, I’d like RvA to be in a list with Tolkien’s LOTR. Is that too ambitious? Maybe, but I love to try.\n\n\n### Q: How do you see the NFT space shaping up?\n**Nuetosis:**\n> I have no idea. It is moving so fast and every day I hear about another possible option. The potential is enormous.\n\n\n### Q: Do you own a Kanaria egg? / thoughts on Kanaria \n**Nuetosis:**\n> No, I don’t own one but I’ve done art for one. I think Kanaria will be huge. People love surprises. The whole blind-egg thing is perfect for the NFT space. \n\n\n### Q: Tell us about the art you made for Kanaria. Did you take inspiration from the emotes?\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EoohFkR.jpg)\n\n\n**Nuetosis:**\n> I made art for a Founder’s Egg. I took heavy inspiration from the emotes. I reviewed all of them and let them sit in my mind for a while through the whole inspiration phase. I believe, if you really look, a lot of these connections will be apparent. Some obvious and some very subtle. In other words, the emotes influenced the art’s formation within the egg. The emotes are written in its DNA.\n\n\n### Q: Have you considered making use of RMRK 2.0 functionality in your future works? \n**Nuetosis:**\n> Yes, I have. I wish I had heard of RMRK before I started. That being said, I’m looking into possibly using it to enhance the series without altering what is already there. I can’t reveal too much at this point, but the potential to nest NFTs within NFTs could mean equipping your warrior before battle and then getting the advantages (or disadvantages) from the stats of all of the equipment you put on. It could be a wondrously interactive experience for those interested in roleplaying and fantasy.\n\nAmazing story. Who would have thought that NFTs could also be used for storytelling? We'll be following the development of **RvA** closely as we're quite excited by its potential. Hopefully, we get to see Nuetosis and RvA in our multi-chain NFT environment.\n\nUntil next week.",

This is a historic event for the entire ecosystem, and we wanted to create something that would remind of it. We have minted a limited series of 300 NFTs, some of them are already sent to those members of the PromoTeam community who made the significant contribution to the crowdloan campaign and deposited more than 5 KSM via our referral links.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*m1GA7D9KD5hMIZFCd7Ri_w.png)\n\nIf you participated using our referral link, check your [Singular account by connecting the KSM address used in the crowdloan](https://singular.rmrk.app/). We plan to use the remaining NFTs to reward active members of our community and to gift them to our partners and to important people of the ecosystem.\n\nThis is a commemorative NFT, so it’s distributed on a free basis. Singular is the official NFT platform from our partner RMRK that allows you to not only store and check, but also to trade NFTs. We hope that someday, our NFT can be shown as the badge of the blockchain veteran who was among the first contributors of Polkadot and Kusama. It’s also possible that in the future we’ll be able to give special offers to our NFT holders. But for now, this is only a commemorative badge, nothing more.\n\nWe have very big plans for the future — the new batch of the crowdloans is coming. We have signed somel new partnerships, the biggest one is with [Integritee](https://www.integritee.network/), the top solution for processing secure data on Kusama, and we are also planning a very large event, also related to NFTs.

        "body": "Over the past 2 years, the DeFi sector has become one of the main driving forces behind the whole crypto market growth. The new alternative financial system with its own ways to exchange money, deposit money to earn interest, even take loans, attracted a lot of new people to crypto. Every major blockchain has its own DeFi platforms. But here’s the problem: every blockchain is an isolated ecosystem with its own set of rules. As the result, all DeFi platforms and tools built on these blockchains are isolated too. Only a few platforms support asset management across multiple chains at once, and none of them supports Kusama and Polkadot so far. KwikSwap fills this gap.\n\n# Multiple chains, one protocol\n\nBasically, KwikSwap is a DEX that works with many blockchains. It can be compared to Uniswap, but there’s a slight difference: although Uniswap has a list of wrapped tokens from other blockchains available for trading, it’s still Ethereum-oriented and doesn’t focus on other blockchains. KwikSwap, on the other hand, is a cross-chain protocol that comes in many flavours. It supports Ethereum, Binance Chain and Kusama parachains, such as Reef Chain, Acala Network and Astar (formerly Plasm). All of them share the same codebase, thanks to EVM-compatible smart contracts on all parachains and BSC. However, even though the code for all parachains is Solidity-based, it was completely rewritten from scratch to be able to work on chains, built on Substrate pallettes.\n\nCurrently, all modules on all chains work separately, because it takes time to build bridges. Kusama parachains also aren’t fully functional yet. The team is finalizing integration with Acala Mandela testnet, so it would be able to implement all these developments on Karura pretty soon. KwikSwap Astar Testnet Demo is also available for testing. To achieve this, the KwikSwap team worked very closely with the Acala and Astar teams for the past half-year. Now KwikSwap will become one of the first DEXes on Kusama. It’s also worth mentioning that only a few DEXes work both on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, so KwikSwap is in a very good position on the market overall. The only major hurdle they have to overcome is connecting all these separate markets into one interface and it’s totally accomplishable by using bridges and wrapped tokens.\n\n> A wrapped token is a cryptocurrency token pegged to the value of another crypto. It’s called a wrapped token because the original asset is put in a wrapper, a kind of digital vault that allows the wrapped version to be created on another blockchain.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*U-Om_Lj8Mu_0Geh0kIQCow.png)\n\n# Kwikstarter — onboarding new blockchain projects\n\nIn addition to the DEX, KwikSwap also features a lot of other initiatives, the most important among them is [Kwikstarter](https://kwikstarter.org/), the IDO platform on Binance Smart Chain. Kwikstarter allows any project to get listed on KwikSwap and then traded in a decentralized way. That kills two birds with one stone: attracts new users who want to get allocations in new projects prior to listing, instead of letting VCs collect all profit, and gives new projects a platform to be listed without paying high fees.\n\nThe platform is currently in the development stage, and the dev team is finishing work on the BEP-20 token sender and claimer, which is going to be used in initial offerings. The devs also have almost finished another version 2.0 of Kwikstarter and it’s going to be launched on Polygon. Kwikstarter is partnered with PDOfinance, a startup, which helps projects fundraise for operations and cash out without affecting the market price in a negative way. Kwikstarter is going to be an important addition to KwikSwap if they market it right.\n\n# How to use KwikSwap?\n\nUsing KwikSwap isn’t harder than using any other DEX such as Uniswap or Sushiswap. All you have to do is connect your Metamask, in the case of using the Ethereum or BSC version, or Polkadot.js extension, if you want to play around with the testnets.\n\nTo make it easier for everyone, we collected all links to DEXes and all guides about KwikSwap variations that exist so far:\n\n1. [Ethereum](https://app.kwikswap.org/#/swap) version — no guide\n\n2. [BSC](https://bsc.kwikswap.org/#/swap) version — no guide\n\n3. [Astar testnet](https://testnet.kwikswap.org/#/swap) version — a [Medium](https://kwikswap.medium.com/kwikswap-dex-plasm-dusty-testnet-demo-4a1827d2c581) guide\n\n4. [Reef](https://reef.kwikswap.org/) version — a v[ideo tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKPqk3dKR40)\n\n5. Karura version is going to be released soon\n\nWe’ll continue updating this list in the future.\n\n# KWIK and liquidity farming\n\nThe main token of KwikSwap is $KWIK. It’s designed to be a reward token on the DEXes for those who provide liquidity to liquidity pools and a governance token for voting on adding various assets to DEXes or listing new projects on Kwikstarter. Also, it’s mandatory to hold a minimum of 1,000 KWIK to be whitelisted for Kwikstarter launchpad sales participation. In a similar fashion to Uniswap, the native KWIK token can be staked in its own liquidity pools. KwikSwap offers 12% APY and fee share for staking on its platform.\n\nThe max supply of KWIK is 250 million, all of them are already minted on Ethereum as ERC-20. All KWIK tokens on other chains will not dilute the existing supply, acting rather like wrapped tokens — the existing tokens will be locked in the contract to mint other versions on BSC and Kusama/Polkadot.\n\nThe price of KWIK has suffered recently due to the hack of the ChainSwap DEX where the token was listed. The hacker stole $8 million due to the security breach and crashed the price of all tokens that were traded on that DEX, including $KWIK. It should be noted, that it wasn’t related to KwikSwap at all, just some bad luck.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOverall, KwikSwap is a pretty promising project if they manage to pull off everything they plan. They have a dedicated team, that works around the clock, they aim to create a small ecosystem that will satisfy the needs of a modern retail crypto investor — a DEX, an IDO launchpad, an NFT marketplace. Given that all these platforms are going to be launched on Kusama/Polkadot, there isn’t so much competition yet, so they have a good chance to succeed. We’ll continue giving you updates on the further development of KwikSwap.

It gives Plasm the opportunity to fill in this gap. Scalability is obviously one of the most crucial demands DApp developers have. Ideally, developers can build any applications on Plasm Network without having to think about scalability limitations. Plasm and Shiden are very similar networks that will be implemented in Polkadot and Kusama. When we say Plasm it also can be applied to Shiden and contrary.  \n\nToday we also discuss a very important point - Kusama Parachain Crowdloan and Shiden Network Crowdloan strategy.\n\nHere is a brief description of Plasm Network, if you know what Plasm network is, go straight to the crowdloan part and the interview with [Sota Watanabe](https://twitter.com/WatanabeSota) - the founder and CEO of Plasm Network.",

        "body": "Hey Kusama fans! Now the first 5 slots are grabbed by the best ecosystem projects — [Karura](https://karura.network/), [Shiden](https://shiden.astar.network/), [Moonriver](https://moonbeam.network/networks/moonriver/), [Khala](https://phala.network/en/khala) and [Bifrost](https://bifrost.finance/).\n\nIn the [previous article](https://app.subsocial.network/1224/kusama-slot-auctions-4-5-slots-winners-19043) we talked about Bifrost and Khala winners of 4 and 5 slots. Ok, what’s next? We have 5 slots, but we have tons of great projects to go to the next auction session. The past Auctions gave us a hint about the next leaders who will be fighting for slots 6–10. According to our [Crowdloan Telegram Bot](https://medium.com/polkadot-ecosystem-promoteam/welcome-the-parachain-auction-telegram-bot-eacf94569e5c), we have these leaders:\n\n## Basilisk\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*6IlwDA9nYz-Z7NiH-_SjdQ.jpeg)\n\n[Basilisk](https://bsx.fi/) currently has more than 116 thousand KSM in contributions. Basilisk is a liquidity bootstrapping protocol built for Kusama. Its mission is to enable frictionless liquidity for the long tail crypto assets. The modular design of Basilisk enables new crypto assets to bootstrap liquidity by choosing the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model which they find most convenient. The first version comes with implementations of a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) as well as XYK pools with order matching transactions. The following iterations will bring more advanced price discovery mechanisms to Basilisk such as auctions and bonding curves. An NFT marketplace is also on its way!\n\nIt was a really amazing competition between Bifrost and Basilisk. We are going to create a special video about HydraDX and Basilisk to talk about the project but this is an absolute leader for the 6th slot.\n\n## Altair\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*tafcqBfprjXd9_619ENH-g.jpeg)\n\nAnother very strong competitor is [Altair](https://centrifuge.io/altair) with more than 19 thousand KSM already collected. It’s the canary network of Centrifuge, the Real-World DeFi hub. Altair is a network that provides access to fast, cheap capital for small businesses and stable yield for investors. It also provides an investment application that acts as an open marketplace of real-world asset pools. Investors can look through the pools provided by Asset Originators and invest in the ones that work for them. Altair also has a very good perspective to become Kusama Parachain and we want to cover and support it in the next auction session.\n\n## Calamari\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*hJ2e1eABu-3zLFVcK4Hk2A.jpeg)\n\n[Calamari](http://www.calamari.network/), Manta Network’s canary-net (the canary-net is an early, highly experimental version of Manta Network, where all new features will be released and tested first), is the plug-and-play privacy-preservation parachain built to service the Kusama DeFi world. It combines Kusama and zkSNARKs to bring on-chain privacy to transactions and swaps.\nAs part of its own suite of products, Calamari Network offers: MariPay, its token-agnostic private payment service and MariSwap, its private AMM-based DEX.\n\n## PolkaSmith\n\n[PolkaSmith](https://polkafoundry.com/) is a bit strange project which came from nowhere and silently got 17 thousand KSM without any media coverage. Hope next time the team will try to present the project to the community in a more open way.\n\n## Robonomics\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*s2nRqH9rI0wkxkx2KVlNUw.jpeg)\n\nAnd one of our favourites — [Robonomics](https://robonomics.network/) with more than 26 thousand KSM contributions. They started late but offered amazing rewards. We are the big fans of Robonomics but we hope they will be more active next time. We will try to support the Robonomics activity.\n\nHere is the 3rd project that also can be one of the leaders in next auction session.\n\n## Genshiro\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*Pnf9LrTxhHRQfD5fCMQ22Q.jpeg)\n\n[Genshiro](https://genshiro.equilibrium.io/en), the canary network of Equilibrium, collected more than 8 thousand KSM as a contribution. Genshiro is introducing a cross-chain money market that combines pooled lending with synthetic asset generation and trading. All DeFi united in one place, Genshiro provides — Lending, Borrowing, Trading, Staking. This project has a good chance to win the next auctions.\n\n## Sakura\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*WXWGU7oy9gynbTelIM0u4A.jpeg)\n\n[Sakura](https://clover.finance/sakura) collected about 5 thousand KSM in the first auction. Sakura & Clover will communicate as sister networks to present a complete foundational layer for cross-chain DeFi on Substrate — on Kusama and Polkadot. Sakura will make use of the original Clover tokenomics design, allowing users to enjoy gasless transactions — where relayers will act on behalf of the sender to cover gas fees in any token within their wallet. This means a user will not be required to have SKU in their wallet to transact on the Sakura network.\n\n## Darwinia Crab\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*MOgmZM85L_Z5nWIQQmpfjg.jpeg)\n\n[Darwinia Crab](https://crab.network/) collected about 3 thousand KSM. Darwinia Network is a decentralized cross-chain bridge network building on Substrate, which is the “Golden Gate Bridge” of the cross-chain ecology. It provides the safest general bridge solution, connecting Polkadot, Ethereum, TRON and other heterogeneous chains by cross-chain assets transfer and general remote chain call. Also, its main application areas include Defi, cross-chain NFT trading market, games, etc.\n\n## Crust Shadow\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*jWFSa2AN_1CgTU-fr3QMIg.jpeg)\n\nOne of our favorites is [Crust Shadow](https://crust.network/). Currently it has more than 7 thousand KSM collected, it’s a really amazing project that needs to be reviewed in more details.\n\nCrust Shadow (Crust on Polkadot) is a decentralized cloud storage project, supporting the TEE and IPFS technologies. It’s the perfect candidate to be used by Web 3.0 applications and all the other Kusama and Polkadot parachains. What makes it stand out among all the other storage projects is the fact that it doesn’t require expensive hardware resources, high-CPU and GPU. One of its main components, the work inspector, runs inside the TEE, in a similar fashion to Phala Network, and that’s why a Crust node can be launched even on a home computer.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*EuMd3ibN-IYlp9KsWvBFyA.jpeg)\n\nThe architecture of Crust has three layers: MPoW, GPoS and the Decentralized Storage Market.\n\n1. MPoW is the layer for storage nodes. To be able to join the network, every Crust node has to verify itself. The node provides information about its free disk space and stored files, that information gets verified by its TEE, and goes to the second layer, to be written to the blockchain. The work inspector in the TEE updates that information every 30 minutes, and if something changes, the node has to pass the verification again, because it can’t be trusted anymore. When a new order for storing a file is submitted, storage nodes download it from an IPFS network, encrypt it with the TEE and submit it to the second layer. Storage nodes get 20% of the fee paid for file storage.\n\n2. GPoS is the layer for stakers. Stakers pack all information, including storage node addresses, file IDs, and verification data, into blocks. The node that stakes a larger amount of CSM tokens has a higher chance to generate blocks. Staking nodes receive 80% of the network fee for file storage, but there’s a twist. Every staker node has its staking quota, and this quota can be increased only by providing more storage, so only the largest storage providers can become the biggest stakers. However, those who don’t have enough staking quotas or enough tokens to produce blocks can delegate them to larger nodes and receive their part of staking fees.\n\n3. The Decentralized Storage Market is a place to submit storage orders. Any user can upload a file onto a standard IPFS public network with the Crust client or even with standard IPFS tools. After uploading a file, its content identifier ID (CID) has to be submitted with the order. Then storage nodes download it, encrypt it, and submit the proof of its storage to the blockchain. Then the user pays a fee for storing it.\n\nThe native token of Crust Shadow is CSM, The total initial amount of CSM is 200 million, and it will be allocated to the community. Crust is a cheap storage network that can become one of the most widely used parachains of Kusama and Polkadot. It can be used to store content for NFTs, games, or even host decentralized websites, so it will definitely be very popular.\n\nAnd that’s all for today.

        "body": "The historic moment for the whole Polkadot ecosystem has come: [the first slot auctions for its Canary network Kusama went live](https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.network%2Fkusama-parachain-auctions%2F). Why is it such an important milestone? The basic Kusama chain (and Polkadot too, but we’ll be talking about Kusama here) is a layer that provides security for the whole network. Aside from that, it has very limited functionality, because it was never supposed to work on its own. And now it’s finally going to be enhanced to its full potential by enabling parachains, each parachain adding new functionality to the whole network.\n\nAll parachains can interconnect via the Relay chain, thus in a few years, when dozens of parachains will get connected, we’ll see the true capability of Kusama. It will work like a web of blockchains with many projects using smart contracts of one parachain, storing data on another parachain, sending funds to other networks via the third parachain, and building new functionality by using all necessary parachains like bricks in the construction of a building or like libraries in software development. Thus the usefulness of the whole network will be growing exponentially with each newly added parachain. That’s why the event of connecting the first parachains to the Relay chain is a significant milestone.\n\nTo get a full understanding of what will be possible with all connected parachains, we have to look at every candidate and its features. But first, we have to discuss what’s the purpose of auctions, how they are conducted, what are their benefits and why every KSM holder has to participate.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*PqMxWFblOJqln5tkRY82rA.png)\n\nRight now we have to make an important remark: while it’s called an auction, in fact, that’s a decentralized voting event. Of course, any project that has enough funding can set a bid for a slot right away and win it, but the amount of KSM that has to be reserved is enormous. Why is it so? Because pretty much every parachain candidate participating in the auction uses the crowdloan functionality to get support from their communities and raise large amounts of KSM tokens. We see it as impossible to win an auction without starting a crowdloan campaign, thus the whole parachain competition narrows down to decentralized voting.\n\n**We’ll break it down into simple points:**\n\n1. Crownloan participants vote for projects by reserving their free KSM tokens\n\n2. Voting is handled by the native Crowdloan module on Kusama, there’s no need to send your tokens anywhere.\n\n3. Every parachain candidate will have its own index for the crowdloan.\n\n4. To vote with your KSM tokens you must send a special transaction with an index of the project you want to help win a slot\n\n5. The module will take your tokens and lock them in its vault. Your tokens have to be available for transfer, not staked or vested.\n\n6. If the project that you support wins the auction, your KSM tokens are locked for one year, until the slot leasing period is over. When it’s over, your tokens will be automatically returned to your address. If the project fails to get a slot, you get your tokens immediately.\n\n7. In return for such a long lockup period, you will get various rewards from the projects that you vote for. Usually, you get rewarded with tokens.\n\n8. If you use someone’s referral link, both you and the person that provided you with the link receive an additional token bonus, so be sure to use a link. We have provided our referral links in the text though.\n\n9. The first auction will be conducted from June 15th, 2021 to June 22nd, 2021. There will be 5 slot auctions, one per week. The last one will end on July 20th, 2021.\n\n10. The exact moment of the auction’s close is determined randomly and retroactively, thus the sooner you allocate the tokens, the better. Otherwise, the VRF module (verifiable random function) may not count your stake at all if you do it late.\n\n***\n\n## Welcome the Parachain Auction Telegram Bot!\n\n[All the information on each and every crowdloan campaign, accessible in one place.](https://app.subsocial.network/1224/welcome-the-parachain-auction-telegram-bot-all-kusama-s-17591)\n\n**What about its features?**\n\nWe’ve designed the functionality to be as simple and straightforward as possible.\n\n**You can:**\n\n* share projects and terms of participation there with your friends;\n\n* add projects to your favorites;\n\n* see instructions on how to participate in a crowdfunding campaign.\nCrowdloan Info Bot;\n\n* check crowdloan's statistics.\n\nJoin [Crowdloan Info Bot](https://t.me/crowdloanbot)\n\n***\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6820/1*q35soGJ75q3J2_wg-uuqdA.png)\n\n# Karura\n\n[Karura](https://acala.network/karura) (Acala for Polkadot) is currently a number one candidate for winning the first slot in the auction. No wonder, as it’s one of the most polished projects in the ecosystem. An EVM-compatible DeFi platform that allows swapping, borrow, lend and stake liquidity. It will potentially become the backbone of all financial operations on Kusama because that’s the place where people will be able to invest their money and trade with low fees. Since it will be the first mover in the ecosystem, most likely it will keep the dominant position for a long time.\n\n**The platform has several modules:**\n\n1. A trustless staking derivative, liquid KSM. The underlying HOMA protocol allows users to join a special staking pool, stake their KSM tokens to gain staking yield and get L-KSM to stay liquid. These L-KSM tokens can be used anywhere across all Kusama-connected chains and can be redeemed anytime for KSM. They can even be used as collateral or as fee tokens.\n\n2. A stablecoin kUSD. It’s based on the Honzon protocol, it’s very similar to MakerDAO and the way how it handles assets. Assets are locked in a CDP (Collateralized Debt Positions) upon a user’s request, after locking them the protocol mints new kUSD tokens. An automatic risk management algorithm checks CDPs all the time to make sure that the value of the collateral is bigger than the value of minted kUSD. The protocol accepts many types of tokens, including almost all tokens of the Kusama ecosystem and even BTC and ETH via bridges.\n\n3. A DEX with an Automated Market Maker.\n\nThe Karura platform accepts any token as a fee, and that fee is very small, compared to such giants as Uniswap, so we think that many users will move to it once it gets launched as a parachain. The native token for the platform is KAR, its max supply is limited by the number of 100 million, and it’s deflationary because all tokens received as fees for transactions, creating CDPs and penalties are removed from the supply by burning them.\n\n# Shiden\n\nShiden (Plasm on Polkadot) is basically the most advanced platform for building smart contracts on Kusama and a hub for dapps, which is unique in the way it rewards not only network validators but also developers of popular dapps. It aims to incorporate a set of tools to use bridges between Kusama and Ethereum and to support all ETH Layer 2 solutions in the future.\n\n**Its main features:**\n\n1. Supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), native to Ethereum, and Web Assembly Machine (WASM), native to Substrate\n\n2. One of its core features, the X-VM (Cross Virtual Machine), creates a layer of abstraction that allows smart contracts to execute calls and read storage data from different contract engines (virtual machines) and languages within the same blockchain.\n\n3. Allows to write contracts in Solidity, ink!, Rust, C/C++, C#, Typescript, Haxe, and Kotlin.\n\n4. Natively supports Metamask and Remix.\n\n5. 50% of its network fees go to reward developers of dapps, the more popular the dapp is, the more its developer gers.\n\n6. It’s possible to change the dapp owner address in Shiden after deploying the contract..\n\n7. They will have an Ethereum bridge implemented in the near future,\n\n8. Optimistic Virtual Machine allowing dapp developers to use such Layer 2 protocols as Rollups. zkRollups are fully supported right now, more protocols to come.\n\n9. Already has a cross-chain DEX KwikSwap running on top of Shiden.\n\nShiden and Plasm are going to be among the most useful parachains for Kusama and Polkadot respectively. They were funded by Binance, OKEx and many VCs, Even while some of their competitors support EVM, Shiden takes it to another level, being the all-in-one solution for any smart contracts-related task. Incorporating multiple virtual machines, protocols and allowing to use them simultaneously with its X-VM, Shiden will defitely attract more developers creating cross-chain products. It may even connect to Ethereum as a layer 2 with all its L2 solutions ready to be used.\n\nIts native token is SDN and its max supply is 70 million. Its main purpose is governance and paying fees. Some of the holders of the original PL already got this one too from the lockdrop, and now it’s the chance to get some during the crowdloan action.\n\n# Moonriver\n\nMoonriver (Moonbeam for Polkadot) is one of the most advanced Ethereum Virtual Machines and a smart contract platform. It can literally run contracts written for Ethereum with a minimum required amount of changes to the source code.\n\n**The main features of Moonriver:**\n\n1. Supports all Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity and Vyper.\n\n2. It’s compatible with all Ethereum tools, such as MetaMask, Truffle and Remix.\n\n3. Supports Ethereum libraries such as Ethers.js, so any developer can work with a Moonriver node as if it was an Ethereum node. Also, it supports Web3 Python and Javascript libraries allowing to use IPC, HTTP, or WebSocket protocols the same way as Ethereum developers do.\n\n4. Cross-chain ERC20 token transactions. Moonriver can connect to Ethereum via the Kusama bridge and via ChainBridge and transfer tokens back and forth.\n\n5. Built-in integrations for oracles, such as ChainLink, Razor Network and Band Protocol.\n\n6. At the same time, it’s still a Substrate-based blockchain and it’s fully compatible with the whole Substrate toolset including block explorers, front-end development libraries, and wallets.\n\nMoonriver is designed for several groups of developers. It can be used by Ethereum developers who want to migrate with their already existing projects to a more scalable and less expensive blockchain, or simply move a portion of their workload until Ethereum scales (which won’t happen in a near future). Some projects have the strategy to replicate on every possible chain, thus we already see some DEXes getting ported to Moonriver. Also, it can be good for those who want to benefit from using smart contracts, who need that functionality in their products, because the native Kusama Relay chain doesn’t have on-chain logic built-in.\n\nIts native token is Moonriver (MOVR) with a genesis total supply of 10 million units and a 5% annual inflation rate. It’s used for smart contracts execution, as the network transaction fee, as the governance token and as a reward to operators running collator nodes. 20% of transactions fees go to Treasury, 80% of transaction fees get burned.\n\nCurrently, Moonriver has second place in the crowdloan campaign, right after the Karura platform. We think that it will take the second slot because smart contracts are crucial for any large blockchain ecosystem and finally enabling them will attract many developers to Kusama and then to Polkadot.\n\n# Bifrost\n\n[Bifrost](https://ksm.vtoken.io/PRMOTM) is a DeFi platform that allows the creation of cross-chain derivatives. It addresses a new problem — users don’t know what to choose in general, staking on PoS chains, such as Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot and Cosmos, or providing liquidity to staking pools on Uniswap, Kava or Balancer. If they choose DeFi yield farming, that means that fewer people stake PoS tokens, and the security of PoS networks decreases. If they choose to stake, they make less money. At the same time, the more PoS tokens are staked, the less of them are traded on crypto markets, and their liquidity greatly suffers, causing insane price swings.\n\nBifrost’s solution is pretty simple — instead of staking PoS tokens on their own, token holders can allocate them to a Bifrost staking pool, and stake them there. After locking up staking tokens, Bifrost creates the same amount of derivatives tokens and sends them back to users. For example, users currently can stake ETH and get vETH for it for DeFi operations. These vETH tokens also can be staked in a pool or used in any other way, thus Bifrost users can get double profit both from staking and DeFi yield farming. Also, it features KSM staking, DOT staking is planned in the future.\n\nThe Bifrost team is building bridges with EOS, ETH, and has many other platform bridges and additional features in the plans. With the active development, it could become a significant part of the infrastructure of Kusama and Polkadot. The main difference between Bifrost Finance and all the other projects, participating in the auctions is that Bifrost doesn’t have a canary network. it will connect its main network to Kusama in case it wins a parachain slot. It will start participating from the second parachain auction until it wins.\n\nIn addition, Bifrost has a working solution for parachain crowdloans, called SALP. The idea is the same as with staking. In the nutshell: users send KSM tokens to the SALP module to support a certain project, the module generates vsKSM and vsBond tokens and sends collected KSM tokens to the project, and in case of auction success users can trade these new tokens while their original KSM are locked during the slot leasing period. SALP can be used to participate in any crowdloan on Kusama, thus it’s one more reason for it to gain more users.\n\nBifrost allocates 3 million BNC as a reward for Kusama auctions, which is 3.75% of the whole BNC supply (80 million). The current ratio is 11 BNC for 1 KSM.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, feel free to use our link, it will give you additional rewards](https://ksm.vtoken.io/PRMOTM)\n\n# Khala\n\nPhala tries to bring a totally new class of smart contract to the blockchain space — private smart contracts. While smart contracts, in general, are pretty secure, if they are properly written and audited, they lack a very important trait that makes a difference for all commercial companies out there, wanting to use blockchain smart contracts but unable to do it because of their lack of privacy. Total transparency is great for idealists and for government-associated initiatives with nothing to hide, but for commercial operations, it’s crucial to keep many things secret, because competition in all areas is very high. Phala can be the solution to this problem.\n\nConfidential smart contracts rely on the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) technology. a special chip included in pretty much every computer, which allows executing code inside a special enclave, independent of an OS or the other hardware, and is 100% hack-proof, that’s why it’s possible to run encryption procedures inside it. The results obtained from the TEE are absolutely trustworthy, given that the node which provides these results can also prove them with the signed attestation. Khala Network supports Intel chips, so it uses Intel services for validation. Execution of smart contracts in such a way doesn’t require any sort of consensus, so one node can successfully run a contract on its own.\n\nThe network has two main types of nodes, gatekeepers and miners.\n\nGatekeepers have to stake a lot of Khala’s native tokens and get elected dynamically. They get rewards for keeping secret root keys for encrypting contracts, sharing them when needed with a chosen miner node over a secure TLS channel.\n\nMiners execute confidential smart contracts. They get rewards for providing their TEE hardware to the network, running a special program pRuntime inside it. They get the encryption key from gatekeepers every time a new confidential smart contract is deployed and gets randomly assigned to a miner node. Every miner can join and leave anytime, they backup the current state of the contract from time to time, so it can be picked by another miner and recovered to be continued. The more tokens they stake, the more tasks they receive.\n\nK-PHA will be the native token of Khala Network. Later it will become swappable with the native token of the main Phala Network which is going to be connected to Polkadot. There will be 1 billion PHA tokens, and 150 million of them will be distributed as K-PHA during the Kusama parachain auction, 1 KSM = 100 K-PHA. These tokens could be used as a fee for miners and gatekeepers, for deploying and executing confidential smart contracts.\n\nKhala Network is a really good technology and it actually can bring commercial companies into the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. It has private smart contracts which can be deployed by any user, and these smart contracts are interoperable, meaning they can connect to each other! That was the biggest downside of using TEE in blockchain-based systems, and now it’s solved. It has a good chance to connect to Kusama in the 4th or 5th auction, thanks to its well-thought tokenomics, several projects that are already using Khala to build services on top of this blockchain, and an enthusiastic community.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, feel free to use our link, it will give you additional rewards](https://crowdloan.phala.network/?invitor=5FYqBsABUr7Wx6FjZVbeYBMtqz1Apu2EKEFettJWLBCMuiiE)\n\n# Crust Shadow\n\n[Crust Shadow](https://crust.network/) (Crust on Polkadot) is a decentralized cloud storage project, supporting the TEE and IPFS technologies. It’s the perfect candidate to be used by Web 3.0 applications and all the other Kusama and Polkadot parachains. What makes it stand out among all the other storage projects is the fact that it doesn’t require expensive hardware resources, high-CPU and GPU. One of its main components, the work inspector, runs inside the TEE, in a similar fashion to Phala Network, and that’s why a Crust node can be launched even on a home computer.\n\nThe architecture of Crust has three layers: MPoW, GPoS and the Decentralized Storage Market.\n\n1. MPoW is the layer for storage nodes. To be able to join the network, every Crust node has to verify itself. The node provides information about its free disk space and stored files, that information gets verified by its TEE, and goes to the second layer, to be written to the blockchain. The work inspector in the TEE updates that information every 30 minutes, and if something changes, the node has to pass the verification again, because it can’t be trusted anymore. When a new order for storing a file is submitted, storage nodes download it from an IPFS network, encrypt it with the TEE and submit it to the second layer. Storage nodes get 20% of the fee paid for file storage.\n\n2. GPoS is the layer for stakers. Stakers pack all information, including storage node addresses, file IDs, and verification data, into blocks. The node that stakes a larger amount of CSM tokens has a higher chance to generate blocks. Staking nodes receive 80% of the network fee for file storage, but there’s a twist. Every staker node has its staking quota, and this quota can be increased only by providing more storage, so only the largest storage providers can become the biggest stakers. However, those who don’t have enough staking quotas or enough tokens to produce blocks can delegate them to larger nodes and receive their part of staking fees.\n\n3. The Decentralized Storage Market is a place to submit storage orders. Any user can upload a file onto a standard IPFS public network with the Crust client or even with standard IPFS tools. After uploading a file, its content identifier ID (CID) has to be submitted with the order. Then storage nodes download it, encrypt it, and submit the proof of its storage to the blockchain. Then the user pays a fee for storing it.\n\nThe native token of Crust Shadow is CSM, The total initial amount of CSM is 200 million, and it will be allocated to the community. There’s a very low chance of Crust Shadow winning one of the first slot auction, but despite this, we see a very bright future for Crust ahead. Crust is a cheap storage network that can become one of the most widely used parachains of Kusama and Polkadot. It can be used to store content for NFTs, games, or even host decentralized websites, so it will definitely be very popular.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, read this article\n](https://link.medium.com/NTppOFEz6gb)\n\n***\n\n# What is PromoTeam?\n\n[PromoTeam](https://medium.com/polkadot-ecosystem-promoteam/we-love-our-work-promoteam-results-for-the-5-month-b1ce45d2b400?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------) — is the international team of Polkadot fans with experience and professional abilities: We excel in community growth, business communications and strategy, promotion, advertising, mathematics, programming, entrepreneurship, and many others areas.

DigitalArt4Climate это инициатива по борьбе с изменением климата. Unique Network — это блокчейн для невзаимозаменяемых токенов (NFT), обладающий огромным спектром возможностей в указанной сфере и функционирующий по модели масштабируемого решения с доказательством доли владения (proof-of-stake). Substrate — технология в основе блокчейна Unique Network активно используется и развивается, проект является частью экосистемы Kusama и Polkadot.\n\nПоскольку климатический кризис продолжает обостряться, крайне важно вовлечь молодежь всего мира в процесс принятия решений. С этой целью Организация Объединенных Наций признала технологию NFT уникальной новой средой для творческого самовыражения, которая может помочь усилить сообщения о действиях по борьбе с изменением климата. NFT — это способ для художников монетизировать свои работы в глобальном масштабе, и продолжать получать оплату за свою работу еще долгое время после ее продажи. Художники в любой точке мира могут привлечь международную аудиторию коллекционеров, которые поддерживают их работу и миссию, и ООН хочет донести эту инновационную форму искусства до следующего поколения художников, которые могут извлечь пользу из технологии, которая может помочь им расширить и монетизировать их работы.\n\nИнициатива DigitalArt4Climate стремится расширить возможности молодых художников, дизайнеров и активистов по всему миру для создания произведений искусства, которые могут вдохновить людей на действия против глобального климатического кризиса. Технологии уже давно являются ресурсом для активной деятельности, и NFT представляют собой новую среду, оптимизированную для цифровой эпохи. Unique Network создаст и разместит NFT маркетплейс DigitalArt4Climate для демонстрации работ художников и веб-дизайнеров. Торговая площадка будет построена на готовом к использованию наборе NFT-решений Unique Network, в котором используется технология блокчейн, оптимизированную для повышения энергоэффективности и снижения выбросов углекислого газа.\n\nВ рамках усилий по смягчению последствий изменения климата Организация Объединенных Наций объявила 2021 год годом «Креативной экономики в целях устойчивого развития», чтобы подчеркнуть ценность творчества, как уникального мощного ресурса в реализации и достижении целей ООН в области устойчивого развития. DigitalArt4Climate в партнерстве с UN-Habitat — это инициатива, направленная на активизацию творческих сил для расширения возможностей решительных действий по борьбе с изменением климата. Инициатива DigitalArt4Climate, возглавляемая IAAI GLOCHA, предлагает молодым художникам со всего мира создавать произведения искусства, которые вдохновят людей на то, чтобы бросить вызов и мобилизовать необходимые ресурсы для отдельных людей в принятии мер [по борьбе с изменением климата](https://action4climate.support/) в контексте Программы действий по расширению прав и возможностей климата UNFCCC.\n\n> «Для решения климатического кризиса Организация Объединенных Наций понимает необходимость использования любого доступного инструмента, чтобы вдохновить людей на серьезные действия по борьбе с изменением климата», — говорит Miroslav Polzer, основатель и генеральный директор GLOCHA. «Мы считаем, что объединение цифровых инноваций (IoT, рынки данных, NFT) с социальными инновациями (новые формы многостороннего сотрудничества) приведет к созданию масштабируемых систем с высоким уровнем вовлечения. Мы пришли к выводу, что инновационная и гибкая инфраструктура Unique Network является ведущей платформой, которая поможет нам принимать меры по борьбе с изменением климата. С помощью этой инициативы мы будем извлекать пользу из мобилизации ресурсов и энергии людей в масштабах всего человечества для создания устойчивого мира»\n\nUnique Network присоединилась к инициативе [DigitalArt4Climate](https://digitalart4climate.space/), чтобы возглавить техническую реализацию программы вместе с организациями-партнерами IAAI GLOCHA, UN-Habitat, [Social Alpha Foundation](https://www.socialalphafoundation.org/), [Exquisite Workers](https://exquisiteworkers.com/) и [Pallette69](http://palette69.design/). Фонд Social Alpha будет проводить занятия для художников и спонсировать награды для победителей. Exquisite Workers является ведущим креативным партнером и контент-партнером инициативы, а Pallette69 является ведущим куратором UX/UI для Designathon.\n\n> «Мы рады продемонстрировать, что принципы технологий распределенных реестров и открытых данных могут быть использованы для поддержки тех, кто готов прилагать усилия по борьбе с изменением климата, помогать им в определении конкретных действий, которые они могут предпринять», — говорит **Александр Митрович, CEO Unique Network**. — «Unique Network очень гордится сотрудничеством по инициативами, связанными с Организацией Объединенных Наций, — всемирной организацией, занимающейся изменением парадигм и обеспечением равенства. Мы верим, что будущее человеческого самовыражения будет связано с NFT, и мы стремимся показать всему миру, как они могут объединить наши разрозненные сообщества в борьбе за спасение нашей планеты»\n\nПервым компонентом этой инициативы стал [Designathon](https://digitalart4climate.space/), дизайнерский конкурс, проведенный в июле, в ходе которого дизайнеры UX/UI соревновались за создание галереи цифрового искусства и торговой площадки, которые продемонстрируют второй компонент этой инициативы — конкурс искусств DigitalArt4Climate. Начиная с Международного дня молодежи, 12 августа, молодые художники смогут представить свои работы на веб-сайте инициативы. По окончании конкурса, работы DigitalArt4Climate будут выставлены на аукцион на торговой площадке DigitalArt4Climate, где художники смогут монетизировать свои работы. Расширенные возможности Unique Network позволят создавать гибкие экономические модели и модели доходов для отдельных художников.\n\nРабочая программа инициативы DigitalArt4Climate была разработана в дополнение к Конференции сторон Организации Объединенных Наций по изменению климата (COP26), — ежегодный глобальный саммит, на котором страны встречаются для достижения договоренностей о том, как коллективно бороться с изменением климата, который проходит в Глазго, Шотландия, в ноябре.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*KF9zxorql8jYLWYUMbhpXg.png)\n\n## О Unique Network\n\nUnique Network — это основа для следующего поколения NFT.

        "body": "Hey Kusama fans! Now the first 5 slots are grabbed by the best ecosystem projects — Karura, Shiden, Moonriver, Phala, and Bifrost. We helped all of them to secure the slots and we are proud of it. PromoTeam is one of the most active contributors and some of our members are the ambassadors of Shiden. Our referrals were in the top 5 contributors in Karura. We are one of the first supporters of Phala Network. Bifrost is the project that has the most resultative referral program. PromoTeam developed and supported the [Bifrost Ambassador program](https://medium.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost-starts-the-ambassador-program-934a8c8aab40) and communities in different regions and platforms.\n\nSo all these results are a big win for all Kusama and Polkadot communities. But we have dozens of very good projects who could not win the first slots. What can they do? Of course, they get their slots soon. And those who save their KSM for these auctions may get some extra profits. Now let’s talk about Bifrost and Khala winners of 4 and 5 slots. Let’s analyze!\n\n# Bifrost\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*CEkFEm_i3req0rvs0KeAVQ.jpeg)\n\n[Bifrost](https://bifrost.finance/) is a DeFi platform that allows the creation of cross-chain derivatives. It addresses a new problem — users don’t know what to choose in general, staking on PoS chains, such as Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot and Cosmos, or providing liquidity to staking pools on Uniswap, Kava or Balancer. If they choose DeFi yield farming, that means that fewer people stake PoS tokens, and the security of PoS networks decreases. If they choose to stake, they make less money. At the same time, the more PoS tokens are staked, the less of them are traded on crypto markets, and their liquidity greatly suffers, causing insane price swings.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*JCrOzIhuCyNGq470UlXlqA.jpeg)\n\nBifrost’s solution is pretty simple — instead of staking PoS tokens on their own, token holders can allocate them to a Bifrost staking pool, and stake them there. After locking up staking tokens, Bifrost creates the same amount of derivatives tokens and sends them back to users. For example, users currently can stake ETH and get vETH for it for DeFi operations. These vETH tokens also can be staked in a pool or used in any other way, thus Bifrost users can get double profit both from staking and DeFi yield farming. Also, it features KSM staking, DOT staking is planned in the future.\n\nThe Bifrost team is building bridges with EOS, ETH, and has many other platform bridges and additional features in the plans. With the active development, it could become a significant part of the infrastructure of Kusama and Polkadot. The main difference between Bifrost Finance and all the other projects, participating in the auctions is that Bifrost doesn’t have a canary network. The same parachain that was connected to Kusama will also connect to Polkadot.\n\n# Khala\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*YJOlPKwuvxFWlcfwogNm5A.jpeg)\n\n[Phala](https://phala.network/en/khala) (Khala for Kusama)tries to bring a totally new class of smart contracts to the blockchain space — private smart contracts. While smart contracts, in general, are pretty secure, if they are properly written and audited, they lack a very important trait that makes a difference for all commercial companies out there, wanting to use blockchain smart contracts but unable to do it because of their lack of privacy. Total transparency is great for idealists and for government-associated initiatives with nothing to hide, but for commercial operations, it’s crucial to keep many things secret, because competition in all areas is very high. Phala can be the solution to this problem.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*DnGLrt5wEMEYWqRwxj8k8g.jpeg)\n\nConfidential smart contracts rely on the [TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)](https://polkadot.network/trusted-execution-environments-and-the-polkadot-ecosystem/) technology. A special chip included in pretty much every computer, which allows executing code inside a special enclave, independent of an OS or the other hardware, and is 100% hack-proof, that’s why it’s possible to run encryption procedures inside it. The results obtained from the TEE are absolutely trustworthy, given that the node which provides these results can also prove them with the signed attestation. Khala Network supports Intel chips, so it uses Intel services for validation. Execution of smart contracts in such a way doesn’t require any sort of consensus, so one node can successfully run a contract on its own.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*ISq1oEOyg4IiYx0v6T9ZlA.jpeg)\n\nThe network has two main types of nodes, gatekeepers and miners.\n\nGatekeepers have to stake a lot of Khala’s native tokens and get elected dynamically. They get rewards for keeping secret root keys for encrypting contracts, sharing them when needed with a chosen miner node over a secure TLS channel.\n\nMiners execute confidential smart contracts. They get rewards for providing their TEE hardware to the network, running a special program pRuntime inside it. They get the encryption key from gatekeepers every time a new confidential smart contract is deployed and gets randomly assigned to a miner node. Every miner can join and leave anytime, they backup the current state of the contract from time to time, so it can be picked by another miner and recovered to be continued. The more tokens they stake, the more tasks they receive.\n\nKhala Network is a really good technology and it actually can bring commercial companies into the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. It has private smart contracts which can be deployed by any user, and these smart contracts are interoperable, meaning they can connect to each other!\n\n# Summary\n\nAnd that’s all for today.

        "body": "The historic moment for the whole Polkadot ecosystem has come: [the first slot auctions for its Canary network Kusama went live](https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.network%2Fkusama-parachain-auctions%2F). Why is it such an important milestone? The basic Kusama chain (and Polkadot too, but we’ll be talking about Kusama here) is a layer that provides security for the whole network. Aside from that, it has very limited functionality, because it was never supposed to work on its own. And now it’s finally going to be enhanced to its full potential by enabling parachains, each parachain adding new functionality to the whole network.\n\nAll parachains can interconnect via the Relay chain, thus in a few years, when dozens of parachains will get connected, we’ll see the true capability of Kusama. It will work like a web of blockchains with many projects using smart contracts of one parachain, storing data on another parachain, sending funds to other networks via the third parachain, and building new functionality by using all necessary parachains like bricks in the construction of a building or like libraries in software development. Thus the usefulness of the whole network will be growing exponentially with each newly added parachain. That’s why the event of connecting the first parachains to the Relay chain is a significant milestone.\n\nTo get a full understanding of what will be possible with all connected parachains, we have to look at every candidate and its features. But first, we have to discuss what’s the purpose of auctions, how they are conducted, what are their benefits and why every KSM holder has to participate.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*PqMxWFblOJqln5tkRY82rA.png)\n\nRight now we have to make an important remark: while it’s called an auction, in fact, that’s a decentralized voting event. Of course, any project that has enough funding can set a bid for a slot right away and win it, but the amount of KSM that has to be reserved is enormous. Why is it so? Because pretty much every parachain candidate participating in the auction uses the crowdloan functionality to get support from their communities and raise large amounts of KSM tokens. We see it as impossible to win an auction without starting a crowdloan campaign, thus the whole parachain competition narrows down to decentralized voting.\n\n**We’ll break it down into simple points:**\n\n1. Crownloan participants vote for projects by reserving their free KSM tokens\n\n2. Voting is handled by the native Crowdloan module on Kusama, there’s no need to send your tokens anywhere.\n\n3. Every parachain candidate will have its own index for the crowdloan.\n\n4. To vote with your KSM tokens you must send a special transaction with an index of the project you want to help win a slot\n\n5. The module will take your tokens and lock them in its vault. Your tokens have to be available for transfer, not staked or vested.\n\n6. If the project that you support wins the auction, your KSM tokens are locked for one year, until the slot leasing period is over. When it’s over, your tokens will be automatically returned to your address. If the project fails to get a slot, you get your tokens immediately.\n\n7. In return for such a long lockup period, you will get various rewards from the projects that you vote for. Usually, you get rewarded with tokens.\n\n8. If you use someone’s referral link, both you and the person that provided you with the link receive an additional token bonus, so be sure to use a link. We have provided our referral links in the text though.\n\n9. The first auction will be conducted from June 15th, 2021 to June 22nd, 2021. There will be 5 slot auctions, one per week. The last one will end on July 20th, 2021.\n\n10. The exact moment of the auction’s close is determined randomly and retroactively, thus the sooner you allocate the tokens, the better. Otherwise, the VRF module (verifiable random function) may not count your stake at all if you do it late.\n\n***\n\n## Welcome the Parachain Auction Telegram Bot!\n\n[All the information on each and every crowdloan campaign, accessible in one place.](https://app.subsocial.network/1224/welcome-the-parachain-auction-telegram-bot-all-kusama-s-17591)\n\n**What about its features?**\n\nWe’ve designed the functionality to be as simple and straightforward as possible.\n\n**You can:**\n\n* share projects and terms of participation there with your friends;\n\n* add projects to your favorites;\n\n* see instructions on how to participate in a crowdfunding campaign.\nCrowdloan Info Bot;\n\n* check crowdloan's statistics.\n\nJoin [Crowdloan Info Bot](https://t.me/crowdloanbot)\n\n***\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/6820/1*q35soGJ75q3J2_wg-uuqdA.png)\n\n# Karura\n\n[Karura](https://acala.network/karura/join-karura?ref=0x346ebc3380be6816f828d1d1df372c51fbe99c95a321d7510403bb98f067695e) (Acala for Polkadot) is currently a number one candidate for winning the first slot in the auction. No wonder, as it’s one of the most polished projects in the ecosystem. An EVM-compatible DeFi platform that allows swapping, borrow, lend and stake liquidity. It will potentially become the backbone of all financial operations on Kusama because that’s the place where people will be able to invest their money and trade with low fees. Since it will be the first mover in the ecosystem, most likely it will keep the dominant position for a long time.\n\n**The platform has several modules:**\n\n1. A trustless staking derivative, liquid KSM. The underlying HOMA protocol allows users to join a special staking pool, stake their KSM tokens to gain staking yield and get L-KSM to stay liquid. These L-KSM tokens can be used anywhere across all Kusama-connected chains and can be redeemed anytime for KSM. They can even be used as collateral or as fee tokens.\n\n2. A stablecoin kUSD. It’s based on the Honzon protocol, it’s very similar to MakerDAO and the way how it handles assets. Assets are locked in a CDP (Collateralized Debt Positions) upon a user’s request, after locking them the protocol mints new kUSD tokens. An automatic risk management algorithm checks CDPs all the time to make sure that the value of the collateral is bigger than the value of minted kUSD. The protocol accepts many types of tokens, including almost all tokens of the Kusama ecosystem and even BTC and ETH via bridges.\n\n3. A DEX with an Automated Market Maker.\n\nThe Karura platform accepts any token as a fee, and that fee is very small, compared to such giants as Uniswap, so we think that many users will move to it once it gets launched as a parachain. The native token for the platform is KAR, its max supply is limited by the number of 100 million, and it’s deflationary because all tokens received as fees for transactions, creating CDPs and penalties are removed from the supply by burning them.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, feel free to use our link, it will give you additional rewards](https://acala.network/karura/join-karura?ref=0x346ebc3380be6816f828d1d1df372c51fbe99c95a321d7510403bb98f067695e)\n\n# Shiden\n\nShiden (Plasm on Polkadot) is basically the most advanced platform for building smart contracts on Kusama and a hub for dapps, which is unique in the way it rewards not only network validators but also developers of popular dapps. It aims to incorporate a set of tools to use bridges between Kusama and Ethereum and to support all ETH Layer 2 solutions in the future.\n\n**Its main features:**\n\n1. Supports both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), native to Ethereum, and Web Assembly Machine (WASM), native to Substrate\n\n2. One of its core features, the X-VM (Cross Virtual Machine), creates a layer of abstraction that allows smart contracts to execute calls and read storage data from different contract engines (virtual machines) and languages within the same blockchain.\n\n3. Allows to write contracts in Solidity, ink!, Rust, C/C++, C#, Typescript, Haxe, and Kotlin.\n\n4. Natively supports Metamask and Remix.\n\n5. 50% of its network fees go to reward developers of dapps, the more popular the dapp is, the more its developer gers.\n\n6. It’s possible to change the dapp owner address in Shiden after deploying the contract..\n\n7. They will have an Ethereum bridge implemented in the near future,\n\n8. Optimistic Virtual Machine allowing dapp developers to use such Layer 2 protocols as Rollups. zkRollups are fully supported right now, more protocols to come.\n\n9. Already has a cross-chain DEX KwikSwap running on top of Shiden.\n\nShiden and Plasm are going to be among the most useful parachains for Kusama and Polkadot respectively. They were funded by Binance, OKEx and many VCs, Even while some of their competitors support EVM, Shiden takes it to another level, being the all-in-one solution for any smart contracts-related task. Incorporating multiple virtual machines, protocols and allowing to use them simultaneously with its X-VM, Shiden will defitely attract more developers creating cross-chain products. It may even connect to Ethereum as a layer 2 with all its L2 solutions ready to be used.\n\nIts native token is SDN and its max supply is 70 million. Its main purpose is governance and paying fees. Some of the holders of the original PL already got this one too from the lockdrop, and now it’s the chance to get some during the crowdloan action.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, see this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pRmDL70kzk)\n\n# Moonriver\n\nMoonriver (Moonbeam for Polkadot) is one of the most advanced Ethereum Virtual Machines and a smart contract platform. It can literally run contracts written for Ethereum with a minimum required amount of changes to the source code.\n\n**The main features of Moonriver:**\n\n1. Supports all Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity and Vyper.\n\n2. It’s compatible with all Ethereum tools, such as MetaMask, Truffle and Remix.\n\n3. Supports Ethereum libraries such as Ethers.js, so any developer can work with a Moonriver node as if it was an Ethereum node. Also, it supports Web3 Python and Javascript libraries allowing to use IPC, HTTP, or WebSocket protocols the same way as Ethereum developers do.\n\n4. Cross-chain ERC20 token transactions. Moonriver can connect to Ethereum via the Kusama bridge and via ChainBridge and transfer tokens back and forth.\n\n5. Built-in integrations for oracles, such as ChainLink, Razor Network and Band Protocol.\n\n6. At the same time, it’s still a Substrate-based blockchain and it’s fully compatible with the whole Substrate toolset including block explorers, front-end development libraries, and wallets.\n\nMoonriver is designed for several groups of developers. It can be used by Ethereum developers who want to migrate with their already existing projects to a more scalable and less expensive blockchain, or simply move a portion of their workload until Ethereum scales (which won’t happen in a near future). Some projects have the strategy to replicate on every possible chain, thus we already see some DEXes getting ported to Moonriver. Also, it can be good for those who want to benefit from using smart contracts, who need that functionality in their products, because the native Kusama Relay chain doesn’t have on-chain logic built-in.\n\nIts native token is Moonriver (MOVR) with a genesis total supply of 10 million units and a 5% annual inflation rate. It’s used for smart contracts execution, as the network transaction fee, as the governance token and as a reward to operators running collator nodes. 20% of transactions fees go to Treasury, 80% of transaction fees get burned.\n\nCurrently, Moonriver has second place in the crowdloan campaign, right after the Karura platform. We think that it will take the second slot because smart contracts are crucial for any large blockchain ecosystem and finally enabling them will attract many developers to Kusama and then to Polkadot.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, use this link](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonriver-crowdloan/)\n\n# Bifrost\n\n[Bifrost](https://ksm.vtoken.io/PRMOTM) is a serious DeFi project featuring KSM and DOT staking and providing DeFi liquidity. It’s the 1st interoperable money market on Polkadot comprised of a lending platform and a professional-grade cross-chain DEX. The Bifrost team is building bridges with EOS, ETH, and has many other platform bridges and additional features in the plans. With the active development, it could become a significant part of the infrastructure of Kusama and Polkadot. Unlike Akala and Plasma, Bifrost doesn’t have a separate network for Kusama, and all Bitfrost auction participants on Kusama will get the same tokens as they will get in the future Polkadot auction.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, feel free to use our link, it will give you additional rewards](https://ksm.vtoken.io/PRMOTM)\n\n# Khala\n\nKhala Network (Phala Network on Polkadot) is a lightweight, powerful and secure platform for creating confidential smart contracts and services built on this technology. The platform uses TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) hardware that will allow Khala to become the new decentralized cloud for confidential computing. It has a good chance to connect to Kusama, thanks to its well-thought tokenomics, several projects that are already using Khala to build services on top of this blockchain, and an enthusiastic community.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, feel free to use our link, it will give you additional rewards](https://crowdloan.phala.network/?invitor=5FYqBsABUr7Wx6FjZVbeYBMtqz1Apu2EKEFettJWLBCMuiiE)\n\n# Crust Shadow\n\nCrust Network is a decentralized cloud storage for Web 3.0, also with good prospects to become a parachain after the first auction. It has successfully passed a series of testnet launches, has a ton of real use applications and collaborations with two dozen ecosystem projects. In fact, this is an IPFS infrastructure for the Kusama ecosystem, a strong competitor to Filecoin.\n\n[If you want to participate in the crowdloan, read this article\n](https://link.medium.com/NTppOFEz6gb)\n\n***\n\n# What is PromoTeam?\n\n[PromoTeam](https://medium.com/polkadot-ecosystem-promoteam/we-love-our-work-promoteam-results-for-the-5-month-b1ce45d2b400?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------) — is the international team of Polkadot fans with experience and professional abilities: We excel in community growth, business communications and strategy, promotion, advertising, mathematics, programming, entrepreneurship, and many others areas.

It’s been one year since the idea started to materialize into the team that has created so much good stuff for the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nDuring this past year, we had different situations: there were difficulties associated with building the team from scratch, there were also a lot of funny and inspiring moments. We keep growing and moving towards our goals. But before we start to talk about our achievements, we want to introduce the very people who form our team.\n\n# Who’s in PromoTeam?\n\n### Alex PromoTeam\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3780/1*Sr6QFPi1nNRWIftlotW6lA.png)\n\n> Polkadot Ecosystem PromoTeam Leader, cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast, entrepreneur. A fan of blockchain technology since 2016.\n\n### Vlady Limes\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*9On5B-BhYarJkFoJulzmAQ.png)\n\n> One of the founders of PromoTeam.

She’s working in the blockchain industry since 2017, and tried many roles: she was a freelancer, built a startup, headed a department in a large media holding, and now she’s building her own NFT-related product.\n\n### Sirius Lee\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*kQrzK-AMsJjB1WHgdxJ4XQ.png)\n\n> Sirius built his first website back when the Internet was still accessible via dial-up, in 2001. Since then, web technologies have improved a lot, and blockchain has given us a chance to build a fair system of social relationships, self-realization and financial independence. Sirius is interested in everything related to IT technologies and Web 3.0.\n\n>In PromoTeam, he’s responsible for all analytics, translations of our articles for the Russian-speaking communities and additional support of the team’s resources.\n\n### Andy\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*feRnQuNztn5LYvN6SSt45w.png)\n\n> Expert in technologies, mobile development, business and finances.

Основные проекты опробовали механизм [Crowdloan](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ru/learn-crowdloans) (краудлон) для участия в аукционах слотов парачейнов. \n\n> Теперь вы можете следить за краудлон-кампаниями кандидатов в парачейны в одном месте — “[Parachain Auction Telegram Bot](https://t.me/crowdloanbot)”. Бот регулярно обновляется и доступен на трех языках. [Подробнее о боте по ссылке](https://medium.com/polkadot-ecosystem-promoteam/встречайте-parachain-auction-telegram-bot-информация-о-всех-crowdloan-кампаниях-в-одном-месте-ebc425a15dde).\n\nВ рамках этих тестов участники приобрели опыт участия в аукционах, с последующим подключениекм к сети Kusama в качестве Parachain (парачейна). Ранее, эти же команды отработали межсетевые транзакции в сети Rococo и другие функции парачейнов.\n\nБлагодаря участию в тестнете Rococo и большому интересу к этим действиям со стороны сообщества, мы можем предположить, какие проекты попадут в список 10 победителей аукционов, подключившихся к Кусама в числе первых.\n\n>Вы можете следить за последними новостями вокруг будущих аукционов в Twitter “[Parachain News](https://twitter.com/DotParachains)”.\n\nСразу оговоримся, что мы не ставим задачей изучить абсолютно все проекты, которые будут участвовать в аукционах слотов парачейнов, а лишь высказываем свое субъективное мнение о проектах, которые наиболее ярко заявили о себе ранее, и в рамках тестнета. Вы можете согласиться или нет, но лучше всего — проведите свой собственный анализ, так как экосистема Полькадот и Кусама удивительно интересна и разнообразна.\n\n>Более подробную информацию о проектах Polkadot вы можете найти на Youtube-канале [PromoTeam Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrvyFYM29oQ-EAejZgYqmWA).\n\n# Что такое аукционы слотов парачейнов и их механизм\n\nЧтобы понять, почему аукционы так важны, для начала разберемся в некоторых технических и теоретических вопросах, чтобы можно было перейти непосредственно к обзору проектов.\n\nАукционы выявят скрытые бриллианты экосистемы Polkadot и Kusama. Но сначала нужно понять принципы, не так ли? [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) (а также Polkadot в будущем) служит цепочкой Relay Chain (Релейная Цепь), которая связывает все парачейны в экосистеме. Парачейны имеют собственное управление и функции, но их безопасность основана на Релейной Цепи. В настоящее время существует ограниченное количество доступных слотов парачейнов, которые можно подключить к Релейной Цепи, поэтому все проекты будут конкурировать за эти слоты на автоматизированных аукционах.\n\nКаждая сеть, подключенная к Polkadot как парачейн, будет иметь некую специализацию, кастомизацию, чтобы предоставлять лучшие решения, такие как: масштабируемость, смарт-контракты, мосты, услуги и функции, которые мы даже не можем себе сейчас представить. Вначале нас ждут битвы за слоты, и это возможность для участников получить токены лучших проектов экосистемы.\n\nВы можете прочитать подробнее об аукционах и порядке их проведения в статье \"Что такое аукцион слотов парачейнов в Polkadot, и как он проявляет скрытую силу Polkadot\". Или посмотреть [обзорное видео](https://youtu.be/ROkHHqkp4M4).\n\n[![Что такое аукцион парачейна в Полькадот, и как он проявляет скрытую силу Polkadot](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_86w-A2QtESRJKTBNTD0NQ.jpeg \"Что такое аукцион парачейна в Полькадот, и как он проявляет скрытую силу Polkadot\")](https://youtu.be/ROkHHqkp4M4)\n\nВ ближайшие дни, все основные команды предложат свою стратегию участия в аукционах. В большинстве случаев такие условия пока не озвучены — но как только появятся обновления, мы их опубликуем.\n\n# Участники аукциона\n\nТеперь давайте вернемся к проектам экосистемы. Для удобства мы разделим их на 3 группы:\n\n1. **Первая группа** — это два важных инфраструктурных проекта для экосистемы Kusama — это мосты, которые соединяют экосистему Kusama с Биткоином и Эфиром.\n\n2. **Вторая группа** — это проекты, которые давно заявляют о желании присоединиться в качестве парачейнов к Kusama, имеют мощный технический бэкграунд, историю участия в Rococo, активность в сообществе и другие факторы.\n\n3. К **третьей группе** мы отнесем проекты, которые не очень активны в экосистеме, или вели работы над проектом непублично, хотя среди них тоже могут быть будущие участники и победители аукционов слотов парачейна Кусамы.\n\nКогда Кусама будет готова к аукционам, нас ждет волна новых проектов. Каждые 3–4 недели к Кусаме будут подключаться новые проекты в качестве парачейнов. Планируется подключить около 30 парачейнов в первый год. Так что нам следует ожидать гораздо большего, чем просто 10 аукционов.\n\n**Первая группа — инфраструктурные проекты**\n\nК ним относятся инфраструктурные проекты для общего блага экосистемы Kusama.\n\nОни получат свои слоты парачейнов в Kusama без аукционов — решением Совета Кусамы, так как для реализации по-настоящему межсетевого, межблокчейнового взаимодействия, нам нужны мосты с Биткоином и Эфиром.\n\nДанные проекты финансируются грантами [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/), и они станут “официальными”, проверенными мостами, построенными в “open-source” формате, и прошедшие полный аудит Web3 Foundation, Parity, сообществом и сторонними аудиторами. [PolkaBTC](https://beta.polkabtc.io/), [Snowfork](https://github.com/Snowfork/polkadot-ethereum) — эти парачейны первыми подключатся к Kusama, и позволят ликвидности из сети Bitcoin и Ethetium наполнять экосистему для будущих аукционов.\n\n**Проекты второй группы**\n\nВ эту группу входят крупные инфраструктурные проекты, которые с большой долей вероятности станут первыми парачейнами экосистемы Кусама.\n\n*Лидеры — [Acala/Karura](https://acala.network/karura) и [Plasm/Shiden](https://shiden.plasmnet.io/), которые соперничатют между собой.*\n\nВ этой группе между собой соперничают две команды — Acala (парачейн для Кусама будет называться [Карура](https://acala.network/karura)), и Plasm ([Shiden](https://link.medium.com/BPC1iORVpfb) для Кусама).\n\n[![Acala/Karura]\n(https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*RcfcWO2u7wqB0zs07yuozg.png \"Инфографика Acala Network/Karura и Plasm/Shiden Network\")](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*RcfcWO2u7wqB0zs07yuozg.png)\n###### Инфографика Acala Network/Karura и Plasm/Shiden Network\n\n\n[Karura](https://acala.network/karura) — это монетарный хаб экосистемы, а [Shiden](https://link.medium.com/BPC1iORVpfb) —  платформа для смарт-контрактов и агрегатор технологий, связанных с их масштабированием, так как непосредственно в сеть Kusama и Polkadot не встроены возможности использования смарт контрактов. Обе команды были самыми активными в тестнете Rococo. Как правило, первыми задания выполняли Acala, вторыми Plasm.\n\nНо, в аукционе всё может измениться, так как мы до конца не знаем подробностей и условия участия, которые предложат команды. Одно кажется бесспорным — оба проекта станут одними из первых парачейнов, подключившиеся к Кусама. Эти два проекта — одни из самых зрелых, т.к. работа по ним ведется уже более 2 лет. У них отличные технические команды и активные сообщества.\n\nОба проекта объявляют реферальную программу, которая позволит участникам аукционов и промоутерам заработать. Эти два проекта — бесспорные лидеры гонки.\n\n>Обновление от 14.05.2021: Аукционная стратегия Karura — https://wiki.acala.network/karura/crowdloan\n\nТакже очень качественный продукт представляют: *Robonomics, Bifrost, Phala, Crust, Darwinia, KILT и Moonbeam*. Остановимся подробнее на каждом из них, обсудим преимущества и ценность для экосистемы Kusama.\n\n[![Robonomics, Crust, Bifrost и Phala]\n(https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*kQNKp2T58SVa_oPzhSpr7g.png \"Инфографика Robonomics, Crust, Bifrost и Phala\")](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*kQNKp2T58SVa_oPzhSpr7g.png)\n###### Инфографика Robonomics, Crust, Bifrost и Phala\n\n\n**Robonomics**\n\n[Robonomics](https://robonomics.network/) — одна из самых технически сильных и продвинутых команд в экосистеме Polkadot. Они строят инфраструктуру для интернета вещей (IoT), роботов, смарт-контрактов, и их взаимодействия между собой, а также с людьми. Самый футуристичный и одновременно очень заземленный проект экосистемы, которому нет причин не стать парачейном первой волны.\n\n**Bifrost**\n\n[Bifrost](https://bifrost.finance/) — серьезный DeFi проект, который планирует предоставлять возможность одновременно направлять в стейкинг токены KSM и DOT, и предоставлять ликвидность в DeFi стиле. Бифрост строит мосты с EOS, ETH, и в планах много других мостов и функционала. Если проект будет активно развиваться, то он может стать очень значимой частью инфраструктуры Кусамы и Полькадот. В отличие от Akala и Plasm, у Bifrost нет отдельной сети для Kusama, и все участники аукциона Bitfrost в Kusama получат те же токены, что и в будущем аукционе Polkadot.\n\n> Обновление от 14.05.2021: вы можете принять участие в аукционе слота парачейна Bifrost, [зарегистрировавшись по нашей ссылке](https://ksm.vtoken.io/PRMOTM) и получив дополнительный бонус. [Аукционная стратегия Bifrost](https://app.subsocial.network/@bifrostru/vs-ksm-mint-drop-obzor-predlozheniya-bifrost-dlya-uchastiya-v-18137).\n\n**Phala Network**\n\n[Phala Network](https://phala.network/) — это легкая, мощная и безопасная платформа для конфиденциальных смарт-контрактов и сервисов, построенных на этой технологии. В основе — оборудование с поддержкой технологией TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), которая позволит Phala стать новым децентрализованным облаком для конфиденциальных вычислений. Проект имеет хорошие перспективы для подключения к Kusama благодаря продуманной токеномике, нескольким проектам — юзкейсам, которые уже используют Phala для запуска сервисов поверх этого блокчейна, и мощному комьюнити.\n\n> Обновление от 02.06.2021: вы можете принять участие в аукционе слота парачейна Phala (сеть Khala для Кусама), зарегистрировавшись по нашей ссылке на странице [Khala Crowdloan Dapp](https://crowdloan.phala.network/?invitor=5FYqBsABUr7Wx6FjZVbeYBMtqz1Apu2EKEFettJWLBCMuiiE), и получив дополнительный бонус.

Успешно прошел серию тестнетов, имеет массу вариантов применения, сотрудничает с двумя десятками проектов экосистемы. По сути, это — IPFS-инфраструктура для экосистемы Kusama, сильный конкурент Filecoin.\n\n> Обновление от 20.05.2021: [Аукционная стратегия Crust](https://medium.com/crust-%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%89%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F/crust-%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B5%D1%82-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B2-kusama-71fc94fd596d).\n\n[![Darwinia Network, Kilt, Moonbeam]\n(https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*sZ67gpKSqqm-LCqGDP3T5g.png \"Инфографика Darwinia Network, Kilt, Moonbeam\")](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*sZ67gpKSqqm-LCqGDP3T5g.png)\n###### Инфографика Darwinia Network, Kilt, Moonbeam\n\n\n**Darwinia Network**\n\n[Darwinia Network](https://darwinia.network/) — децентрализованный кросс-чейн мост разработанный на Substrate, который обеспечивает общее мостовое решение, соединяющее с Ethereum, TRON и другими гетерогенными чейнами, путем передачи кросс-чейн активов и общего удаленного вызова по цепочке. Кроме того, его основные области применения включают: DeFi, кросс-чейн маркет NFT, игры и т.д. Дарвиния достаточно далеко продвинулась в создании инфраструктуры и сообщества, и может претендовать на попадание в парачейны первой волны.\n\n[![Инфографика активности разработчиков на GitHub]\n(https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*XIb7OIHT8qWcNdAZhjG53A.png \"Инфографика активности разработчиков на GitHub\")](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*XIb7OIHT8qWcNdAZhjG53A.png)\n###### Инфографика активности разработчиков на GitHub\n\n\n**Moonbeam**\n\n[Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) реализует EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) и платформу для смарт контрактов — узкоспециализированный чейн уровня 1.5 — зеркало Ethereum’s Web3 RPC, аккаунтов, ключей, подписок, логов и многого другого. Платформа Moonbeam расширяет базовый набор функций Ethereum с помощью дополнительных функций, таких как он-чейн управление, стейкинг и кросс-чейн интеграция. Мунбим будет представлен в Kusama своей копией Мунривер (Moonriver). Этот проект — альтернатива и конкурент Plasm.\n\n**KILT**\n\n[KILT](https://www.kilt.io/)  обеспечивает базовый уровень для проверяемых учетных данных в мире Web 3.0. Используя преимущества блокчейна, они собираются привнести реальную аккредитацию в цифровой мир, создав для бизнеса способ проверки учетных данных, и вывести доверие на совершенно новый уровень.\n\nKILT выиграли тестовый аукцион третьими по счету, если они смогут хорошо представить свой проект аудитории, вероятно подключение в первой волне парачейнов.\n\n[![Инфографика активности в социальных сетях]\n(https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*Mli-vb7pvVsupSt6uxqvfw.png \"Инфографика активности в социальных сетях\")](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*Mli-vb7pvVsupSt6uxqvfw.png)\n###### Инфографика активности в социальных сетях\n\n\n**Третья группа — проекты в стадии разработки**\n\nК третьей группе относятся проекты, которые мало проявили себя в экосистеме, или не обозначили формально свои планы подключиться в качестве парачейна, либо об их команде или продукте мало известно. Эти проекты могут тоже стать парачейнами — как первой, так и последующих волн. В любом случае, с ними стоит познакомиться ближе.\n\n**ChainX/SherpaX**\n\n[ChainX](https://chainx.org/en/) — шлюз цифровых активов и Релейная Цепь второго уровня для Polkadot. Реализует кросс-чейн обмен активами, лидер в новом направлении — Bitcoin Cross-DeFi. Проект начал разработку давно, но долгое время был неактивен, и только перед аукционами парачейнов стал проявлять себя. Слабая активность в GitHub.\n\n**Zenlink**\n\n[Zenlink](http://www.zenlink.pro/en/) стремится к созданию кросс-чейн сети DEX нового поколения. Интегрируя модуль Zenlink DEX, Zenlink позволяет парачейнам быстро обрести функции DEX, и делиться ликвидностью с другими парачейнами.\n\n**HydraDX**\n\n[HydraDX](https://hydradx.io/) — разрабатывает уникальное решение, позволяющее объединить все активы в один общий пул ликвидности, обеспечивая беспрецедентную эффективность. Это хорошая идея, но она все еще находится в стадии разработки. Однако, это очень интересный и свежий подход к DeFi. Команда пытается заново изобрести устоявшийся формат пулов ликвидности, и она очень активна в гонке парачейнов. Мы ждем тестовой сети, чтобы увидеть их функции в действии, и сделать выводы о продукте.\n\n**Equilibrium**\n\n[Equilibrium](http://www.equilibrium.io/) — межсетевой денежный рынок, сочетающий лендинг-пулы с выпуском синтетических активов и торговлей. Еще не запущен. У команды есть банковский опыт, и они планируют предоставить инструменты для работы с синтетическими активами, а также привнести в DeFi лучшие элементы классической финансовой системы.\n\n**Subsocial**\n\n[Subsocial](https://subsocial.network/) — открытая платформа для децентрализованных социальных сетей и маркетплейсов. Уникальный социально-финансовый протокол Polkadot. Она является цензуроустойчивой, и имеет встроенные механизмы монетизации. Построена на Substate и IPFS стеке. Это мощный игрок, с поддержкой сообщества Polkadot/Kusama и Web3 Foundation. Имеет хорошие перспективы стать парачейном в ближайшее время.\n\n**Centrifuge**\n\n[Centrifuge](http://www.centrifuge.io/) — это протокол для децентрализованных финансовых активов. Интересная идея и талантливая команда. Мы ждем более подробной информации и их предложений для экосистемы Кусамы.\n\n**Litentry**\n\n[Сеть](https://www.litentry.com/) поддерживает кросс-чейн агрегирование идентификаторов. Построена на Substrate..\n\n**PolkaFoundry**\n\nЭто [платформа](https://polkafoundry.com/) для создания удобных приложений DeFi и NFT без барьеров.\n\n**MathChain**\n\n[Блокчейн](https://mathchain.org/) второго уровня на основе Substrate.\n\n**DataHighway**\n\n[Сложный парачейн IoT](https://www.datahighway.com/), основанный на Polkadot, где можно стейкать, управлять, майнить, и иным образом участвовать, используя новый токен DHX и связанную с ним децентрализованную автономную организацию (DAO). Рынок межсетевых данных.\n\n**Bit.Country**\n\nНачни свою собственную [бит-кантри](https://bit.country/). Метавселенная, NFT и экономика токенов\n\n**SubDAO**\n\nЭто [инфраструктура DAO](http://www.subdao.network/), основанная на Polkadot, где любой децентрализованной организации позволено удобно создавать и управлять DAO. SubDAO не только соединяет DAO с dApps для реализации межсетевого управления DAO, но также соединяет Web 2.0 и Web 3.0. Концепция DAO для экосистемы Кусама — отличная идея. На такую функциональность существует большой спрос, и мы надеемся, что этот проект также представит нам хороший продукт в ближайшем будущем.\n\n**Encointer**\n\n[Encointer](https://encointer.org/) — это фундаментальный редизайн денег. Основываясь на принципе равных возможностей, каждый человек получает универсальный базовый доход и цифровое удостоверение, не полагаясь на центральную власть.\n\n**Edgeware**\n\n[Edgeware](http://www.edgewa.re/) — это чейн смарт-контрактов с казначейством, управляемым сообществом, децентрализованной системой предложений и сетью DAO. Старый проект с хорошей предысторией, но пока не раскрыл планов стать парачейном. Вероятно, они будут участвовать во второй волне аукционов или станут паранитью (Parathread).\n\n# Больше обновлений в будущем!\n\nМы продолжим добавлять дополнительную информацию в эту статью по мере ее появления, т.к. мы получаем отзывы и новые данные от команд и комьюнити. Мы будем добавлять новых участников, когда они объявят о своих планах присоединения к сети. Вы можете добавить эту статью в свои закладки и время от времени проверять ее.\n\nЖдите продолжения!

You can claim your Kanaria Eggs, add emotions, characteristics and grow your own unique NFT Kanary. Claiming **only from 2 KSM**! Here is more detals!\n\n🔹**Kusama Kanaria!**\n\nToday is a special review. Kusama ecosystem gets its first own NFTs, thanks to the project that we are going to tell you about. It’s called Kanaria.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*v-6A2amZ0hN3aYfY.png)\n\n🔹**What is Kanaria?**\n\nKanaria is a collection of Kusama-native cheap and eco-friendly NFTs, all without smart contracts! It’s a collection of digital eggs that will “hatch” on June 1st into utility-NFTs that will not only look good but also carry some platform bonuses and customizable traits.\n\nHow RMRK — the platform Kanaria is built on — works is described on the RMRK website, but in a nutshell, they put graffiti onto the chain which we then interpret according to some very strict specifications. This interpretation allows us to see, create, trade, send, and even emote to NFTs. RMRK is a set of rules and standards for interpreting special data. It works on extrinsics of Kusama network, the idea is to put info about NFT, ownership, transactions right to Kusama blockchain by extrinsics. We will put the link to the wiki to learn about extrinsics, more. https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-protocol-info#extrinsics-and-events.\n\nKanaria is an in-production test and a tech demo of this technology.\n\nThe RMRK standard is compatible with any Substrate-based chain, so Polkadot, Kusama, Unique Network, and any of the others listed here. The Kanaria project is hosted on Kusama, using the RMRK standard.\n\n🔹**Emotes and Hatching**\n\nNote: an emote works like a switch. If you send an emoji once, and then again from the same address, it turns off. NFTs built on top of RMRK can be emoted on. It’s possible to send them reactions as you would on social media. Indeed, some people who claimed eggs already went all out with the emotes! Emotes can have an effect on the type of bird you’ll get when hatching the egg. There are two main types of traits, cosmetic and functional.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*w1k72KcULeAhLRyK.png)\n\n\n🔹**Cosmetic Elements**\n\nThe birds will all have a common base form, with several different sub-elements that can vary: eyes, beak or mouth, background, foreground, body, headwear, wings, wings-decal, hand, neck, feet, traits or aura.\n\nAnd we come for our Special offer, if you claim your EGG in 2 hours after the premiere of this video, you will get an additional special NFT inside the Kanaria NFT, after the eggs are hatched.\n\n[![Kanaria special offer](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KkzqVoouJNtJeP7yLqvp3Q.jpeg \"Kanaria special offer\")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLPjZTHSr9I)\n\n>Special claim offer, available only for 2 hours after the premiere video 20 April 2021 4 PM UTC +0. Subscribe our YouTube not to miss the announcement — https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrvyFYM29oQ-EAejZgYqmWA\n\n\n🔹**Item Transferability**\n\nBecause RMRK 2.0 which the birds will be based on supports nested NFTs, this means NFTs can own NFTs. You will be able to send certain items and decals from your bird to another. This means your NFT will actually get its own NFTs on hatching.\n\nFor example, a bird random-rolled a surfboard. This surfboard is now added as a child NFT of your bird; in other words, the bird’s item. Your bird can send this NFT to another bird which can then equip it at its owner’s behest (using a special USE interaction).\n\nNote that only props are transferable — decals, foreground props, headwear, etc. You cannot transfer emotion, expression, skin colour.\n\n🔹**Visualizing Traits**\n\nNon-cosmetic or functional traits are traits that give long-lasting platform-specific benefits. They are visualized on the birds, not as items or decals, but something like sockets, “slots” on the bird, or a bird’s aura — depending on what our illustrator comes up with. For the mechanics of Traits and what they mean, and how they will work in the context of Kanaria, please see the Trait Socket System section.\n\nWhile emotes can slightly influence the chances of getting these coveted and valuable functional traits, the type of egg you claim directly influences your chances, with Super and Founder eggs having the best chances.\n\n🔹**Probabilities**\n\nIt’s important to note that emotes DO NOT guarantee an outcome. They only affect probabilities to get a certain trait. In other words, and in true Kusama form, no promises.\n\n🔹**How to Hatch**\n\nThere are two requirements for your bird to be hatchable.\n\n**Collect 10 (HATCHING) emojis before May 17th**. Since an emoji is a switch, you can only submit one emoji from one account once per NFT, a second submit will turn it off), you will need to find 9 friends to help you hatch your egg! (Yes, making alt accounts is allowed, but where’s the fun in that?)\n\n**Click the “Hatch” button in the Kanaria UI of your egg (button available after May 17th)**.\n\n🔹**Trait Socket System**\n\nWhat’s possibly the most exciting aspect of these birds is the Trait Socket System.\n\nEvery bird will have a certain number of trait sockets. If you’ve ever played the Diablo games, you’ll understand the reference.\n\nSuper Founder egg birds have 5 sockets.\n\nFounder egg birds have a minimum of 2 sockets, up to 5, depending on how many from this category are claimed. They are also guaranteed an epic (95 of 9999 eggs can possibly have this) tradable prop.\n\nRare egg birds have a minimum of 2 sockets, up to 4 if all are claimed. 50 of them will have one trait socket pre-filled with the 0.1% Rev trait. They are also guaranteed a rare tradable prop (950 of 9999 eggs can possibly have this). All rare eggs will also have flock pairings with one or more LE eggs (see below).\n\nLimited edition egg birds have a minimum of 1 socket, up to 4 traits if all are claimed. 15 of them will have one trait socket pre-filled with the 0.1% Rev trait. Some Limited Edition eggs will have a special trait that can only be rolled if the same address also holds a matching Rare egg (they are in a flock).\n\n>Wait for our special claiming offer, the hint — it is connected with tradable property for the eggs. Our claim period will be from 4 PM UTC +0 to 6 PM UTC+0 London Time 20 April 2021\n\n**Subscribe not to miss important info:**\n\n* https://t.me/ParachainNews\n\n* https://t.me/kanaria_official\n\n* https://twitter.com/rmrk\n\n* https://twitter.com/PromoTeamPD\n\n* https://twitter.com/DotParachains\n\n🔹**Trait Replacement**\n\nYou will not be stuck with the traits you get or equip. The traits are NFTs too, only they are not transferable. In order to make room for another trait, you must CONSUME (burn) an existing one. This system allows you to continuously upgrade and evolve your bird over time with additional platform-specific bonus functionality that will only become apparent as our ecosystem grows.\n\nThis is where the birds will get their TRUE long term power. This is what makes them revolutionary utility-bearing NFTs, never before seen elsewhere. This is what’s going to shake the NFT landscape, and we’re just getting started.\n\n🔹**Do I have to hatch?**\n\nNo, you can keep the egg as a collectible. It will have no functionality, but we cannot influence what other projects will do with these (who knows what blockchain-based game might accept rotten eggs as currency in the future?)\n\nIs it better to have a well-emoted egg or one with no emotes?\n\nIt can swing either way. A ton of interesting emotes might have interesting effects, but it’s entirely possible that an emotionless egg will actually end up being the rarest.\n\n\n# What are the steps to participate?\n\n**1.** Follow [our link](https://kanaria.rmrk.app/?ref=promoteam) to the project page and connect to the platform through the Polkadot.js wallet\n\n**2.** Go to the sections \"Your Nest\" -> Open Synaps-> complete the KYC\n\n**3.** Complete the KYC and wait for the event from PromoTeam and Kanaria.

We are here to help the Polkadot community become the best. Many PromoTeam members have been contributing to the ecosystem for over 2 years. Many people know and respect us.\n\nIf you are in the Polkadot ecosystem, PromoTeam is interested in you. We do not make any distinction, we try to help and support everyone. Let’s interact and make new friends.\n\n**Your project will be adopted, understood, and well known.**\n\nHere are some areas in which we have achieved significant success, and are ready to share it with you:\n\n**Content creation.**\n-Website content and promo , website development, and search engine optimization.\n-Wiki, Whitepaper, Tokenomics — we can help to form the documentation.\n-Social media content: twitter, telegram, discord, wechat, reddit and others\n-Articles and even a whole series for Medium are an important part of promoting of any project. Articles will be provided with unique ---illustrations and video content, if necessary.\n-Video content — promo videos, interviews , AMAs, reviews, instructions for use, and other video content at the highest professional level, using professional equipment. We attract professional speakers and actors, all content will be performed at the highest level. You can use these videos not only on the Internet but also at presentations and exhibitions as an intro.\n-Visual content — GIFs, pictures, banners, stickers, infographics, and advertising materials. Layouts for printing and distribution. \n-Development of design and corporate identity of the project.\n\n**Creation and development of the community.**\nPromoTeam are specialists in creating and developing a community, we work only with real people, we do not use cheats, bots and other incorrect methods, and this is the rule for us.\n-Create and arrange groups in telegram, wechat and discord\n-Create in the same style — twitter, telegram channels, wechat, discord, youtube channel and others of your choice\n-Develop a strategy for attracting users and developing the community.\n-Provide admins for groups, including different language zones.\nToday we work in the following language zones: English, Chinese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Dutch and Spanish, if necessary, we can involve native speakers of other languages ​in the development of the community.\n-Images for post\nCreating content is only half the way, we need to attract attention to it and we have all for this.\n\nThe most important thing - is the reputation on all the main platforms for delivering information, we strictly treat the quality of messages that come from us, so they trust us and your message will not be lost.\n\nWe can use both standard and non-standard promotion schemes, contact us and we will develop the most optimal and effective strategy for promoting the project.\n\nWe have our effective information delivery channels, and we are partners of many information platforms of the ecosystem:\nHOT DOT NEWS — YouTube, Medium\nDOT Features — YouTube , Medium\nPolkadot Ecosystem Promoteam — Twitter , Medium\nAnd many others, our friends and media partners.\n \nWe are validators and actively developing this area. We plan to become part of the node and validation ecosystem to make society more decentralized. We also have a community development validator’s reward program.\n**\nParticipation in the management and development of decentralized project institutions.**\nThis is an important aspect and so far not many founders and project teams think about it. We suggest to make the foundation for forming a healthy community of executives who will take part in community governance and treasuries. You need to make efforts to form such institutions, otherwise, by the time the mainnet is launched, you simply will not have enough candidates that the community will know and support. Or they will not be able to adequately assess the prospects for the development of the community, correctly place accents and priorities, and build relationships with the community based on respect for the contribution of everyone. This is not a trivial task and many communities underestimate it until they face it in reality. We have a plan and a program to train people for decentralized institutions within each community and this is an ambassador program.\nParticipation in the formation and support of applies for treasuries for the projects, creation of treasuries and funds.\nAnother very important aspect of the functioning of the projects in the Polkadot ecosystem is Treasuries that build in by the architecture of projects on Substrate, many projects will have Treasuries, but even in Kusama and Polkadot there are still problems with their use.\nWe will help to create your Treasuries, rules for its functioning and requirements for projects to participate in financing. Recommendations for Council members to work with applications and the community.\nThere are also ideas for the formation of decentralized funds to finance community activities within the framework of ambassador programs.  \n\n**Creation, development and management of representatives / ambassadors programs.**\nThis is the pearl of our activity and the “icing on the cake” of promotion in the Polkadot ecosystem. We sincerely believe that each project should have an ambassador program, which will be the basis not only for promotion, but also for the organic formation of the community, the value of the project and token, the formation of Governance and other decentralized project institutions. We started to implement the ambassador program in the Bifrost project and to a limited extent in some other projects. We will share our practice and encourage other projects to use our experience.\nContact us, we will tell you a lot of interesting things about the formation of the program of representatives/ambassadors of the project.
